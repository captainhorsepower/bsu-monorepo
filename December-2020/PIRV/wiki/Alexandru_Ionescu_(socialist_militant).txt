Alexandru Ionescu (socialist militant)
Alexandru Ionescu July 29 1862 July 9 1929 was a Romanian typographer early labour leader and socialist journalist A founding member of Romanian Social Democratic Workers Party PSDMR he was part of its leadership throughout its existence at the same time working for the unionisation of the Romanian workers One of the few party leaders with actual working class background Ionescu opposed collaboration with the bourgeois political parties and continued to support the existence of a workers party even after the other leaders of PDSMR decided on the party s dissolution A founder along fellow minded socialists of the Working class Romania circle Ionescu grew estranged from the main socialist grouping due to disagreements over the newly established labour legislation Joining the government sanctioned corporations he supported at times ideas contradictory to his former socialist positions but ultimately he rejected corporatism as a form of labour organisation Despite some attempts at collaboration he would never reintegrate in the mainstream socialist movement Early life and labour activism Alexandru Ionescu was born in Bucharest in a working class family After finishing primary school he was employed as a compositor at the State Publishing House then as a student typographer at the Carol G bl publishing house Becoming a maker up he also worked in the typographic enterprises of the newspapers Curierul financiar and Le people Roumain In 1880 after four years of apprenticeship he became a qualified worker and was employed by the typography of the newspaper L Ind pendance Roumaine Around 1883 Alexandru Ionescu was introduced to socialist ideas by the left wing journalist Constantin Mille Entering the administration council of the Gutenberg Society a benefit society reuniting employers and employees in the typographical industry in 1885 Ionescu supported the collaboration of the association with the De teptarea Society which only comprised workers even becoming secretary of the latter society By 1886 he was the editor of the Gutenberg the organ of the typography workers and along Mille a member of the Bucharest s Circle of Social Studies His articles frequently criticising the working conditions in the industry brought him into conflict with the employers as a result the Telegraful typography fired him for inciting workers to rebellion In November 1887 he was again fired this time from the State Publishing House after organising a rally protesting the arrest of socialist activist Anton Bacalba a During the same period Ionescu was one of the founders of the first workers cultural association in Romania the Workers Circle sitting as one of its two secretaries Dissolved by the authorities in 1888 following major strikes the Circle was reorganised in the second half of 1889 even succeeding to publish a journal Revolta Through the activism of Ionescu Bacalba a and Panait Mu oiu the Circle s membership rose to 300 by the beginning of 1890 This allowed the transformation of the Circle into the Workers Club in February 1890 The Executive Committee of the Club included Ionescu Mille Ioan N dejde and Mu oiu The same year he joined the other members of the committee as an editor at the Munca newspaper one of the earliest Romanian socialist journals His articles covered various issues from social investigations and the electoral system to the abuses of the authorities and the repression of the peasants In 1892 he was elected vice president of the Gutenberg association four years later being promoted to president During this period he worked towards the creation of a nationwide trade union of the workers in the typographic domain Through his efforts by the end of the 19th century the typographers from Ia i Ploie ti and Craiova became associated with Gutenberg Activity in the PSDMR Following years of exploratory meetings in 1893 Alexandru Ionescu was one of the supporters of the creation of the Romanian Social Democratic Workers Party PSDMR providing it with working class support by affiliating the Gutenberg to it The First Congress of the PSDMR elected him member in the General Council position he held until the party s disestablishment in 1899 As member of the PSDMR s leadership Ionescu toured the country extensively attempting to gather support for party from the workers of Gala i Br ila Craiova Ploie ti and Ia i With the revival of the Circle of Social Studies he was one of the socialists who held regular conferences at the Sotir Hall group which also included N dejde Vasile Mor un and Constantin Dobrogeanu Gherea Between 1891 and 1899 he was constantly on the socialist electoral lists for the second college along Ioan N dejde Mor un and Mille Despite opposition from other leaders Alexandru Ionescu supported the creation of an official organ of the party The Second Congress of the PSDMR eventually decided in his favour and in 1895 the newspaper Lumea Nou went into print Through his personal efforts he was also able to establish a party typography receiving praise at the Fifth Congress of the party During late 1896 following several discussion at the Bucharest s Workers Club 14 professional organisations decided to create a labour federation the Union of the guilds trade unions with Ionescu elected as president of the federation s Permanent Council in January 1897 In the meantime he continued his journalistic activity publishing in Munca Lumea Nou Democra ia social Gutenberg Almanahul socialist and other socialist newspapers and magazines His articles targeted the miserable life of the working class the growing unemployment as well as the politics of the two bourgeois parties Ionescu also collaborated as a reporter with the republican newspaper Adev rul but left in 1894 after the party decided the collaboration with a bourgeois journal counter productive to the workers cause As one of the few members of the council with genuine working class background Alexandru Ionescu opposed the attempts of other leaders to forge alliances with the bourgeois parties the National Liberal and Conservative parties seeking to bring the party closer to the proletariat As a result he come into a dispute with fellow PSDMR leader Vasile Mor un who envisioned the activism of the party as limited to memorandums and negotiations with the National Liberal and Conservative politicians Favouring direct workers action instead Alexandru Ionescu participated in several strikes including those that took place at the Bucharest Railways Workshops 1888 at the Army s Tailoring Workshops 1893 and in the leather cutters strike of 1891 On December 30 1898 as president of the Gutenberg association he declared a general strike of the typography workers The demands included a 9 hour workday Sunday rest and a minimal weekly salary Despite several pressures from the employers and the state authorities who even sent soldiers in the typographies to replace the striking workers the strike gathered 600 workers and lasted for ten weeks It also garnered support from the International Typographical Secretariat in Berne which supported it financially The principles demanded by the Gutenberg association were accepted by 24 of the 28 typographical workshops in Bucharest the enterprises which refused to accept the demands of the workers notably included the publishers of Adev rul owned by former socialist Mille Alexandru Ionescu s growing opposition to the bourgeois members of the PSDMR leadership the generous youth and their collaboration with the National Liberals led to his estrangement from the party Nevertheless he still supported the unity of the labour movement and condemned the creation in 1898 of a new workers club influenced by nationalist and anti Semitic ideas In March 1899 in a Lumea Nou article Ionescu firmly rejected the idea of dissolving the party gaining the support of Iosif N dejde I C Frimu and Constantin Z Buzdugan As a result he was not invited at the hastily organised Sixth Congress of the PSDMR when the bourgeois dominated leadership decided on the party s disestablishment Although the Roman delegation invited him as its representative Ionescu rejected in an open letter the legality of the Congress Expressing his contempt for the bourgeois leaders of the party who had publicly abandoned basic socialist tenets such as collective property and internationalism he called on the workers to reject any resolutions made at the meeting As the generous faction led by Mor un and George Diamandy decided to go ahead with the transformation of the PSDMR into a non Marxist party most of the proletarian delegates including Frimu Buzdugan and Alecu Constantinescu resigned in protest Rom nia Muncitoare While those responsible for the disestablishment of the PSDMR went on to join the National Liberal Party PNL Alexandru Ionescu attempted to reorganise a workers party with the help of other proletarian former members of the PSDMR A meeting of the few remaining socialist which also included Iosif N dejde Buzdugan and Dimitrie Marinescu attempted to revive the party in a June 1899 meeting but the clubs had already dissolved in the aftermath of the Sixth Congress and little progress was possible Nevertheless Ionescu participated in the 1899 elections as the Bucharest Workers Club candidate for the second electoral college succeeding in obtaining more votes than Vintil Br tianu future prime minister of Romania although not enough to win the seat Another feeble success of the reorganised Club was the organisation of the May Day celebrations in 1900 Around this period he also bought along fellow worker Alexandru Georgescu the former party s typography which had accumulated major debts Although this decision would be later criticised by other socialists the transaction allowed the typography to continue printing the journal Lumea Nou In 1901 Ionescu withdrew from the presidency of the Gutenberg association but continued to collaborate with the local socialists Later that year the former members of the PSDMR which remained faithful to the socialist ideas created a new organisation the Rom nia Muncitoare Working Class Romania Circle which in January 1902 began publishing the first short lived series of the eponymous newspaper Alexandru Ionescu the managing editor of the new publication condemned as opportunist the betrayal of the bourgeois former members of the PSDMR who had by then received high political offices with the support of the PNL When Ioan N dejde referred in an Adev rul interview to the socialist revival in Romania as an utopia Ionescu replied by expressing his belief that the workers should have their own organisations despite the industrial backwardness of the country Furthermore he rejected the idea that the workers movement should act as an appendage to the PNL A dispute also arose among the editorial staff of Rom nia Muncitoare around the Law of the Crafts also known as the Missir Law after the PNL politician that proposed it The law based on corporatist principles while bringing some improvements to the working conditions in Romania prevented the formation of trade unions A group around I C Frimu D Marinescu and tefan Gheorghiu firmly opposed the law while another which included Ionescu and Iosif N dejde had a more favourable view believing corporations will gradually improve workers lives Alecu Constantinescu also supported joining corporations although he hoped these could be transformed into socialists organisations from within The supporters of the corporation succeeded in imposing their editorial line however the newspaper ceased printing soon after Corporatism and later life Maintaining his support for the corporations as a mean to organise the working class Alexandru Ionescu succeeded in being elected vice president of the Bucharest Graphical Arts Corporation in 1902 His attempts to introduce into the corporation s charter some guarantees for workers welfare such as minimum wage or fixed working time failed as they met the resistance of the employers In March 1903 Ionescu was also elected in the Trade Chamber of the Bucharest Chamber of Commerce and Industry however his election was invalidated on the intervention of the agriculture minister who feared Ionescu would be able to introduce socialist ideas on the agenda of the organisation In July 1903 Ionescu suffered a temporal lobe abscess and although he quickly underwent surgery he was left with amnesic aphasia forcing him out of all public positions Only in the second half of 1904 he was able to retake his position in the corporation also starting to work in the typography he owned He maintained his post in the leadership of the corporation until the end of the decade at times supporting positions that came into clear contradiction with the socialist ideas he had championed around the turn of the century Resigning from the corporation in April 1909 Ionescu expressed in a Rom nia Muncitoare article his disenchantment with this employer controlled form of workers organisation and recognised that trade unions were better fitted to represent the interests of the proletarians However he did not join the socialist movement Only after World War I did Ionescu return to socialist politics issuing in 1919 a manifesto with ideas similar to those professed by the Socialist Party of Romania PSR On the insistence of Ilie Moscovici he also joined the Bucharest organisation of the PSR but left in September after disagreeing with the party s support of an waiters strike Ionescu regarded the waiters demands for the right to request tips as contrary to socialist ideals and deplored the attacks against waitresses printed in press of the PSR Later that year he briefly edited the newspaper Social democra ia Social democracy but his health problems prevented him from continuing activism One of his last public appearances was during the funeral of Mille in 1927 when he read a eulogy for his former companion Ionescu died in Bucharest in July 1929 being interred in

its purpose on Darren s departure he said According to the narrator this proved that Darren didn t understand the experiment Another interpretation of course would be that he did The Times criticised the programme for setting the programme in an artificial rubbish dump for health and safety reasons comparing it to various fakery scandals that had taken place in the programme Blue Peter in the past year However Nigel Kendall of the same newspaper called the programme entertaining and its contestants likeable while Paul Hoggart said that it gets its point across Website TV Scoop said that the programme was a great experiment but did not approve of the inclusion of fame hungry participants and compared the programme to the most recent series of Big Brother The website Hecklerspray gave the programme a negative review calling the participants absolute fucking morons and Orange gave the programme 3 out of 5 stars Channel 4 controller Julian Bellamy commented on the programme s failure during Edinburgh Television Festival 2008 saying that it didn t have the human narrative you need and that it was a little bit too like other reality shows Controversy An argument started in the camp between Jermaine and Selena on Day 15 which resulted in some participants stating that they felt intimidated by his actions The programme s producers had to enter the dump and discuss along with the other members of the group whether Jermaine should remain on the programme Jermaine himself offered to voluntarily leave the programme but the producers and the other participants decided to keep him This was criticised in some reviews one of which called Jermaine a loud mouthed moron References External links Dumped at Channel4 com Dumped on IMDb Dumped at TV com

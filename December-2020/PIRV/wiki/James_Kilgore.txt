did in South Africa showed that he had broken with terrorism as a method of struggle preferring the hard patient slog of building among ordinary workers in the trade unions and among working class

overseas but in the end we will find them and bring them to justice Kevin Ryan US Attorney in the San Francisco Federal Court where Kilgore was wanted for almost three decades said The arrest and prosecution of James Kilgore the last of the fugitive SLA members represents the Department of Justice s commitment to bringing terrorists be they domestic or foreign to justice We will never forget their acts and the passage of time will not diminish our resolve or our vigilance After being extradited to the United States Kilgore eventually pleaded guilty to both the possession of explosives

Prudence Couldn t Swim a crime fiction story set in Oakland California and Zimbabwe His fiction has generally received favorable reviews Adam Hochschild award winning historian noted that too few writers have Kilgore s wide angle vision This promising first book vividly rooted in his own experience leaves me eager to read more by him Well known South African based reviewer Percy Zvomuya himself a Zimbabwean called Kilgore s fiction debut A fascinating book cleverly written not overly sentimental and manages to capture the vibe of Zimbabwe in the early 1980s Most Zimbabweans will recognize themselves in the novel their mannerisms their quirkiness and well their Zimbabweanness pour out from the pages one of the most important books about Zimbabwe 2008 American book award winner Frank Wilderson commented The book is fast paced and funny extolling two literary virtues often missing on the Left It is a good read the work of a great storyteller But it is also an invaluable object lesson the work of a committed activist Post release Since his release from prison in 2009 Kilgore has lived with his family in Champaign Urbana Illinois where he has worked at the University

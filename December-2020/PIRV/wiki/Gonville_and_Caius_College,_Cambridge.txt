Mary Bateman appointed as the first Master of the new college his former chaplain John Colton later Archbishop of Armagh By the sixteenth century the college had fallen into disrepair and in 1557 it was refounded by Royal Charter as Gonville Caius College by the physician John Caius John Caius was master of the college from 1559 until shortly before his death in 1573 He provided the college with significant funds and greatly extended the buildings During his time as Master Caius accepted no payment but insisted on several unusual rules He insisted that the college admit no scholar who is deformed dumb blind lame maimed mutilated a Welshman or suffering from any grave or contagious illness or an invalid that is sick in a serious measure Caius also built a three sided court Caius Court lest the air from being confined within a narrow space should become foul Caius did however found the college as a strong centre for the study of medicine a tradition that it aims to keep to this day By 1630 the college had expanded greatly having around 25 fellows and 150 students but numbers fell over the next century returning to the 1630 level only in the early nineteenth century Since then the college has grown considerably and now has one of the largest undergraduate populations in the university The college first admitted women as fellows and students in 1979 It now has over 110

Rogerson Buildings and grounds Old Courts The first buildings to be erected on the college s current site date from 1353 when Bateman built Gonville Court The college chapel was added in 1393 with the Old Hall used until recently as a library and Master s Lodge following in the next half century Most of the stone used to build the college came from Ramsey Abbey near Ramsey Cambridgeshire Gonville and Caius has the oldest purpose built college chapel in either Oxford or Cambridge which has been in continuous use as such The chapel is situated centrally within the college reflecting the college s religious foundation On the re foundation by Caius the college was expanded and updated In 1565 the building of Caius Court began and Caius planted an avenue of trees in what is now known as Tree Court He was also responsible for the building of the college s three gates symbolising the path of academic life On matriculation one arrives at the Gate of Humility near the Porters Lodge In the centre of the college one passes through the Gate of Virtue regularly And finally graduating students pass through the Gate of Honour on their way to the neighbouring Senate House to receive their degrees The Gate of Honour at the south side of Caius Court though the most direct way from the Old Courts to the College Library Cockerell Building is only used for special occasions such as graduation The students of Gonville and Caius commonly refer to the fourth gate in the college between Tree Court and Gonville Court which also gives access to some lavatories as the Gate of Necessity The buildings of Gonville Court were given classical facades in the 1750s and the Old Library and the Hall were designed by Anthony Salvin in 1854 On the wall of the Hall hangs a college flag which in 1912 was flown at the South Pole by Cambridge s Edward Adrian Wilson during the famous Terra Nova Expedition of 1910 1913 Gonville Court though remodelled in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries is the oldest part of the college New lecture rooms were designed by Alfred Waterhouse and completed by Rattee and Kett in 1884 Tree Court is the largest of the Old Courts It is so named because John Caius planted an avenue of trees there Although none of the original trees survive the court retains a number of trees and the tree lined avenue which is unusual for a Cambridge front court West Road

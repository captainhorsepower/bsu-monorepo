written by Frank Ocean Waynne Nugent and Kevin Risto of the duo Midi Mafia who also produced the track The song appears on his debut mixtape Nostalgia Ultra which was released on February 18 2011 When asked by The Quietus about his own interpretation of the character in the song it was noted that Ocean politely withdrew saying he d enjoy that discussion but he doesn t want to spoil his audience s experience of his songs He further commented but you have fun with the imagery and for me the whole concept that everything has to be Like nobody gets upset with a director when a director s film isn t about his life People think that with a recording artist that shit has to be like a fucking play by play of their whole life but it s not It s imagery and a little bit of satire The track was released as the second single from Nostalgia Ultra digitally on October 18 2011 by Def Jam Recordings Composition Swim Good has been interpreted as a first person debate about killing yourself The track has been called an astonishing suicide song and that Ocean finds himself dressed in black Like I m ready for a funeral tormented by heartbreak and on the verge of driving his car into the sea The song has been described as a grim escape fantasy which has the singer driving his car to the shore his trunk bleeding with broken hearts The hook of the song ends with the refrain of I feel like a ghost no Swayze ever since I lost my baby Pitchfork described the singing as heart battered The Quietus states that the song makes you realise the ocean means a lot more to this songwriter than the reference to Ocean s Eleven that he s cited in interviews he is mysterious and tragic Yahoo Music stated that in his calm ultra controlled tone Ocean sings about feeling like he s on his way to a funeral as he drives around town in a black suit and a body in the trunk Reception Swim Good received positive reviews from music critics and was widely considered to be one of the best tracks off Nostalgia Ultra Sam Hockley Smith of The Fader commented that Swim Good was one of the highs off of record as did Anthony Osei of Complex magazine Pitchfork commented that the track was a brooding highlight off the record In addition Yahoo Music s Billy Jounhson described it as a breakout song AbsolutePunk stated the song was hard hitting and proved that Ocean s voice is as great as his knack for writing thoughtful pop songs NPR s Andrew Noz commented that in the standout Swim Good he sings of putting broken hearts in the trunk of a Lincoln Town Car and driving to the ocean as they bleed through Several critics noted the song for its dark subject matter On the week of September 10 2011 the song debuted at number eighty one on Billboard s Hot R B Hip Hop Songs chart and peaked at position number seventy On July 31 2012 the music video was nominated for three MTV Video Music Awards Best Direction and Best Male Video with Ocean being nominated for Best New Artist for his work with the video Promotion Ocean released a behind the scenes video promoting a music video for the track It was filmed by his cousin and released on Ocean s Tumblr on August 11 2011 The video directed by Nabil Elderkin was officially released on September 16 2011 The video was released on Frank Ocean s Vevo on September 23 2011 and was available for purchase on iTunes on September 24 2011 The Fader commented that Elderkin serves up a fairly literal interpretation of Swim Good Nostalgia Ultra s most heart wrenching metaphor It does however feature an explosion a panda mask and the second appearance of Ninja Frank Ocean The video features Frank Ocean and his samurai sword star and it blends Asian and aquatic vibes with impressive cinematography Rap Up reported tanquility turns traumatic in Frank Ocean s suspenseful video The clip opens with a dazed Ocean going through the motions of eating popcorn though he s wearing an Odd Future mask that does not have a mouth opening It features a 70s orange and black Lincoln limousine and Ocean in an orange samurai robe mysteriously driving along the coastline and deep into the forest He then whips out his sword and draws blood from his unsuspecting female victim He sets fire to the vehicle and watches it burn on the cliff during the explosive conclusion In the closing moments viewers are lead sic to believe that the mystery woman was also the passenger of the rear compartment and the video ends when the camera zooms in on Ocean s blood stained sword The video adds color to the already chilling and unusual storyline for alternative R B song according to Yahoo Ocean embarked on a solo tour through North America and Europe to promote both the mixtape and his other musical projects The set lists to the various shows varied though Swim Good was performed at all shows The track was included during Ocean s setlist at the April 2012 Coachella Musical Festival Complex magazine stated the audience sang every word of ULTRA s suicidal serenade Swim Good which closed with the same seagull chirps it does on the tape Personnel Frank Ocean vocals Midi Mafia production Ariel Chobaz mixing Calvin Bailiff recording

Despite studio pressure to release the film in 3 D Favreau chose to film traditionally and in anamorphic format widescreen picture on standard 35 mm film to further a classic movie feel Measures were taken to maintain a serious Western element despite the film s inherently comic title and premise The film s aliens were designed to be cool and captivating with some details such as a fungus that grows on their wounds created to depict the creatures as frontiersmen facing adversity in an unfamiliar place Cowboys Aliens premiered at the 2011 San Diego Comic Con and was released theatrically in

stronger and more durable than humans only Jake s wrist weapon or a well aimed round from a rifle can kill them with a single shot Ella tells them that the previous attackers were just scouts She also

in 1997 when Universal Pictures and DreamWorks bought film rights to a concept pitched by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg former president at Malibu Comics which he described as a graphic novel in development They hired Steve Oedekerk to write and direct the film which Oedekerk planned to do after completing Nutty Professor II The Klumps Rosenberg who formed Platinum Studios to pursue adapting Cowboys Aliens and other Malibu Comics properties into film and television joined as a producer By 1998 Oedekerk left the project to pursue a remake of the 1964 film The Incredible Mr Limpet with Jim Carrey By 2004 the film rights were acquired by Columbia Pictures who did not move the project beyond development In 2006 Rosenberg published Cowboys Aliens as a graphic novel In the following year Universal and DreamWorks partnered again to adapt Cowboys Aliens into a film In June 2008 Robert Downey Jr entered negotiations to star in the film as Zeke Jackson a former Union Army gunslinger While Downey Jr was making Iron Man 2 he told director Jon Favreau about Cowboys Aliens Favreau investigated the project and in September 2009 he joined as director Downey Jr left the project in January 2010 to star in Sherlock Holmes A Game of Shadows and later in the month Daniel Craig was hired to replace him Favreau said Craig s portrayal of James Bond brings a certain virtuosity He also described Craig On the one hand he s like this Jason Bourne type a leading man who s also a lethal character but on the other hand he s also got a lot of humanity and vulnerability to him In April 2010 Harrison Ford was cast alongside Craig Favreau had cast Craig and Ford in the film because they were actors who suited the action adventure roles so the characters would be less seen as comedic The director compared Ford in particular with John Wayne in having a sense of history with the actor and the role Before Cowboys Aliens Ford had previously acted in the Western films A Time for Killing 1967 Journey to Shiloh 1969 and The Frisco Kid 1979 While Ford is well known for playing Indiana Jones the filmmakers wanted to avoid giving him a cowboy hat that would remind audiences too much of Jones Writer Alex Kurtzman said We needed to make sure that no pun intended we tipped a hat to iconography of Harrison Ford and also presented the audience with a very different version Olivia Wilde was cast in one of the lead roles and Favreau called Wilde s character the key to the film Sam Rockwell was cast in a supporting role as Doc The character was described as a large Mexican in the original script but when Favreau and the writers learned of Rockwell s interest in the film they reconceived and expanded the role Favreau himself is known for appearing in his films but for Cowboys Aliens he chose not to make a cameo appearance because he thought it would affect the tone of the film Favreau s face does appear on a wanted poster as Todd Kravitz in the scene establishing Craig as Lonergan When asked about how the film was developing Rosenberg stated It s incredible Sometimes it s like seeing exactly what was going through my head when I first had that spark in my head as a kid Jon Favreau s bringing his own talent and vision with the adaptation but at the same time it remains true to what I was really trying to get at in the original story Steven Spielberg one of the film s executive producers visited the director and the writers during pre production to look over the script and the artwork He provided Favreau with a collection of classic Western films Spielberg also invited the director and the writers to a private screening of several Western films and provided live commentary on how to make one properly The films included Stagecoach My Darling Clementine and Destry Rides Again Spielberg made several other suggestions a main enemy alien Jake s final use of the gauntlet being to decapitate an alien and that Jake and Ella s first kiss should occur in the climax of the film Writing In the film s period as a developing project under several studios different versions of the screenplay were drafted by numerous screenwriters beginning with Steve Oedekerk Other screenwriters involved included David Hayter Thomas Dean Donnelly Joshua Oppenheimer Jeffrey Boam Thompson Evans and Chris Hauty When Universal and DreamWorks re partnered in 2007 they hired Hawk Ostby and Mark Fergus In 2009 Ostby and Fergus were replaced by Alex Kurtzman Roberto Orci and Damon Lindelof Kurtzman and Orci analyzed American Western films including The Searchers Orci said The first draft was very kind of jokey and broad and then it went very serious You kind of swing back and forth between the two extremes and the tone until you find the exact right point where a Western and a sci fi movie can really shake hands without it seeming unnatural Imagine you re watching Unforgiven and then Aliens land Orci explained Orci also said The comic has the themes of enemies uniting to fight a common enemy and has the setting of that specific time period so we kept the inspiration from all of that In terms of the specifics of the story and who these characters are we wanted the audience to be surprised and to not feel like they ve already seen everything if they were fans of the comic So while the themes and the setting and many of the elements are a great inspiration the story is completely adapted and translated for live action The aliens were loosely based on the Anunnaki gods of Zecharia Sitchin s interpretation of the Babylonian religion who have a distinct interest in gold Filming Cowboys Aliens was not originally planned to be shown in 3 D When approached with the idea by DreamWorks Favreau was not interested stating that Westerns should be shot only on film as opposed to being shot digitally which is required for modern 3D technology and didn t want it to be converted after filming That would be like filming in black and white and colorizing it he reasoned Director of photography Matthew Libatique shot Cowboys Aliens in the anamorphic format on 35 mm film to further a classic movie feel On a budget of 163 million principal photography for Cowboys Aliens began at Albuquerque Studios in New Mexico on June 30 2010 One of the filming locations was Plaza Blanca The White Place where Western films like The Missing 3 10 to Yuma City Slickers Young Guns and The Legend of the Lone Ranger had been filmed Sound stage work took place in Los Angeles with additional location shooting at Randsburg California Filming finished on September 30 A scene in which Craig s character rides a horse alongside a ravine and jumps down it onto a spacecraft emulated many scenes in American Western films where cowboys rode along a moving train and jumped on it Favreau said the scene referenced the one in the film Raiders of the Lost Ark 1981 where Indiana Jones chases a truck and noted that a similar scene existed in the film Stagecoach 1939 saying We re constantly referencing back to our roots Cowboys Aliens also make multiple references to Close Encounters of the Third Kind such as the introduction to the aliens through the bright lights on their aircraft and an upturned paddle steamer in the middle of the desert The film also tease s monster movies and the scenes in the paddle steamer were a deliberate homage to Alien Design and effects Scott Chambliss was hired as the production designer based on his work on Star Trek produced by Orci and Kurtzman The visual effects were created by Industrial Light Magic ILM represented by Roger Guyett and Eddie Pasquarello as visual effects supervisors Under the supervision of Shane Mahan Legacy Effects created practical puppet aliens and full scale alien speeders New Deal Studios constructed a miniature of the paddle steamer that is seen upturned in the film Kerner Optical built a miniature of the alien ship and bluescreen stand ins The film also featured visual effects by Fuel VFX The Embassy Ghost and Shade VFX with previsualization from Halon Entertainment Favreau noted that Cowboys Aliens focuses on a specific aspect of the alien genre which primarily revolves around the films of the 1980s And although we have quite a bit of CG I like the way they told stories before before you could show everything with CG And it was a real unveiling of the creature little by little and using lighting and camera work and music to make it a very subjective experience And so we tried to preserve that here In designing the film s aliens ILM was careful to make the creatures cool and captivating Guyett stated that they adopted a similar approach to that of District 9 The trick was to make the aliens interesting through their behavior and what happens to them and that was something that District 9 did very well You were drawn into their world a bit and their idiosyncrasies had an immediate impact they ate cat food But those details overwhelm certain design aspects so I was striving to find some behavior that fit in well with the Western genre where you have people in very arduous conditions fighting the elements And I thought that the irony of all this was that the aliens turn up and it could be more exaggerated for them They re frontiersmen in a way traveling to another place and having to deal with all the adversities of the climate And in our case we played up the fact that they weren t comfortable in our world There are flies all around them they don t like the light and when they were wounded and exposed a strange fungus grows around them The use of anamorphic widescreen rather than shooting full frame flat and cropping later gave ILM no extra room to re frame shots it was a challenge to show both nine foot tall aliens and smaller humans in the same space Instead Guyett said they shot more areas in case portions of the shots were lost In filming the gun battle between the cowboys and aliens in which the aliens move at twice the speed of the humans actors were required to ride through the scene on horseback and shoot at men in gray suits and three foot tall hats they aimed at faces drawn by Jon Favreau on the top of the hats A big challenge for ILM s texture artists was to show the aliens in both a dark cave environment and harsh sunlight The creatures were rendered in high resolution for close ups dirt and wounds were added to the aliens to emphasize the injuries they sustained in battle After Favreau requested that the aliens experience a very unpleasant biological reaction to being wounded on Earth the texture team created a yellow fungus like look on the scars of the aliens To design the fungus texture supervisor Martin Murphy searched the Internet for real pictures of mold and growth on trees and eventually designed a fried egg pattern The heads of the aliens were based on those of sea turtles after Favreau encountered sea turtles during a trip to Hawaii At the suggestion of Steven Spielberg an ber alien was also designed It was unclear if the red scar Jake gives the ber alien after escaping vivisection would be enough of an identifier to distinguish it from other aliens so the creature was redesigned with translucent pale skin due to the lack of time spent outside Favreau described the ber alien as more fleshy and anthropomorphic than the other aliens and Murphy commented There are some parts of him like his arm that you can see into It s almost like glass or ice or gelatiny surface that blends into a dryer area The sic there s pieces of him that are more like a soft shell crab or shiny and wet In addition to the aliens other visual effects were required for the speeders the alien spaceship its interior environment re creations and the head up display for Jake s arm gauntlet For the invasion of the town of Absolution both practical laser lighting and fire effects were utilized along with practical ships and effects enhancements ILM artists had to enhance the initial look of the alien bolos the cables used to abduct people with renderings such as extra lights after viewers thought the studio had failed to paint out the cables in the film s first trailer For a scene in which Jake and Ella ride on a speeder the actors were filming on a practical mock up against bluescreen they were digitally replaced in wider shots Themes In Cowboys Aliens Director Jon Favreau sought a plausible approach to how humans from the late 19th century could confront extraterrestrial beings armed with advanced weaponry He said It was very well laid out well planned and there were a lot of discussions with a lot of actors who called me to task on things that seemed too convenient so we made sure we earned each step The director also sought to maintain a Western tone as aliens appeared in the film saying It s very easy to just cut the string and then all of a sudden the action starts and you re in Independence Day Favreau cited the works of John Ford and Sergio Leone as sources of inspiration as well as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid Favreau also wanted the science fiction element to stand on its own referencing Alien Predator and Close Encounters of the Third Kind He said of both genres It s about finding the intersection of those two genres If you do it right it honors both and it becomes interesting and clever and a reinvention of two things that people understand the conventions of instead of just a retread or remake or sequel or reboot of a film you ve seen before In the Americas Native American nations were severely damaged by European settlers specifically because of the Europeans advanced military technology Favreau compared the film to the historical confrontation in the frustration of not having the technology to allow you to prevail It s always the low tech culture that feels powerless when faced with an enemy that has technology on their side In the film the cowboys are the low tech culture and the aliens with advanced technology possess the belief of Manifest Destiny Favreau also said of the premise It allows the cowboys and Native Americans to come together which would be impossible had there not been a greater common enemy It sets the Western up in a very classic way and then turns it on its ear When the aliens appear the film becomes a road movie in which the main characters try to track the aliens team up with different groups and ultimately confront the aliens Favreau compared the gathering to The Magnificent Seven in facing seemingly insurmountable odds in their confrontation The character of Meacham also presents an unconventional take on Christian principles to support the film s main theme of redemption According to Favreau Meacham s teaching Doc how to shoot not only references similar scenes in other Westerns but also teach es him how to be a person Meacham s dying words to Jake God don t care who you were Son only who you are speaks of the central theme of redemption The hummingbird that Jake sees at various points in the film is a good spirit that could represent either Alice or Ella an alternate theory is that Ella was an angel that helped Jake get over Alice Favreau also suggested a back story to Cowboys Aliens the ber alien is the mastermind of the invasion all other aliens are worker bees possibly genetically engineered by another species of aliens that remained on their home planet and sent the worker bees as conquistadors Marketing Cowboys Aliens which crosses genres with the American Western element of cowboys and the science fiction element of extraterrestrials has an inherently comic title and premise At the San Diego Comic Con International in July 2010 director Jon Favreau hosted a presentation and was accompanied by the film s primary cast members including Harrison Ford in his first Comic Con appearance In the presentation Favreau explained to audiences that he intended the film as a serious mix of the Western styles of Sergio Leone and John Ford and really scary science fiction like Alien and Predator The first trailer for the film appeared in the following November and The New York Times reported that film audiences found the premise comedic Eddie Egan the president of marketing at Universal Pictures acknowledged the misconception and said The trailer is the first very public step in reconciling the tone of the movie with the more immediate effect of the title on its own The studio anticipated a marketing campaign that would demonstrate that the film is a tough minded adventure like Unforgiven by Clint Eastwood During Super Bowl XLV on February 6 2011 the studio aired a TV spot for Cowboys Aliens Hours before the American football game Favreau used Twitter to link followers to the spot online Entertainment Weekly reported It roused the geek hive fan base and stirred new speculation about his hybrid of classic Westerns and extraterrestrial invasion thrillers After the spot aired Favreau said the first trailer was intended as an introduction to pique people s curiosity and that the Super Bowl TV spot was showing more of the sense of adventure as things unfold In April 2011 Favreau and Roberto Orci appeared at WonderCon in San Francisco where they presented nine minutes of film footage and answered questions about the film Favreau explained that marketing would show only a brief glimpse of the aliens of the title before the film is released He explained the withholding of certain elements I think there are enough visionary people involved with this film that there is an understanding that there is a personality that the marketing campaign can take on as well as the film itself I want to make sure that if the audience goes to see the film there is going to be a lot of surprises in it that they haven t seen in the marketing materials Release Cowboys Aliens had its world premiere at the San Diego Comic Con International in San Diego on July 23 2011 It was commercially released in the United States and Canada on July 29 2011 and in other territories in ensuing weekends Paramount Pictures International also released the film in IMAX theaters around the world as it did for Favreau s previous film Iron Man 2 Box Office Mojo forecast that Cowboys Aliens would gross 95 million total in the United States and Canada For the comparatively low figure the website cited that the marketing had not contextualized the film effectively and that hybridized Western films like Jonah Hex and Wild Wild West were not successful at the box office In territories outside the United States and Canada the website forecast 140 million total citing that American Western films are not historically popular but that the premise of the alien invasion and the presence of international stars like Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford would generate interest In contrast box office tracker Paul Dergarabedian said the film s combination of cowboy and extraterrestrial themes in particular would attract audiences Dergarabedian also believed that audiences familiarity with Craig as character James Bond would help the film Box office On the opening day of Cowboys Aliens estimates showed that its opening day gross was 13 0 million and it came in second place to The Smurfs opening day gross of 13 3 million This was considered a surprise since Cowboys Aliens was expected to be the clear winner for the weekend Estimates then showed Cowboys Aliens and The Smurfs tied at the 1 spot for the weekend with 36 2 million each However when the actual results for the weekend were announced Cowboys Aliens won the weekend with 36 4 million just beating out The Smurfs which grossed 35 6 million The film grossed 100 240 551 in the U S and Canada making it the 500th 100 million domestic movie as well as 74 581 774 internationally bringing its worldwide total to 174 822 325 With its high cost the film was a financial disappointment with the Los Angeles Times listing the film in 2014 as one of the most expensive box office flops of all time Reception Cowboys Aliens received mixed reviews from critics On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 44 based on 254 reviews with an average rating of 5 57 10 The site s critical consensus reads Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford are as dependably appealing as ever but they re let down by director Jon Favreau s inability to smooth Cowboys Aliens jarring tonal shifts On Metacritic the film has a score of 50 out of 100 based 41 critics indicating mixed or average reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B on an A to F scale Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film saying It sounds kooky on paper but on the screen cowboys and aliens make beautiful fun music together Honeycutt felt that the success of the film s blend of aliens and western themes was due to the determination by everyone involved to play the damn thing straight Even the slightest goofiness the tiniest touch of camp and the whole thing would blow sky high But it doesn t He criticized the aliens which he said don t rate as characters existing as moving blobs you shoot at in a video game Variety s Peter Debruge echoed Honeycutt s sentiments that the potential hamminess of the premise is offset by the cast particularly Craig through a mix of ruthlessness and sensitivity He considered that Wilde had the opposite effect stating she appears out of place among her grizzled co stars Debruge appreciated the attention paid to the roots of the two genres saying beneath all the state of the art special effects beats an old fashioned heart one that prizes both of the genres in play and concluded that a canny blend of CG and practical effects serve the sci fi elements well while location shooting and Mary Zophres form fitting period duds make the West look its best Nick Pinkerton of The Village Voice said the Western elements of the film were lovingly handled but felt the science aspects a gimmick and much more standard fare in comparison He added that Ford enlivened by dude garb seems to enjoy himself in front of a camera for the first time in decades Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four writing that as preposterous moneymakers go it s ambitious and well made The acting from the large cast is of a high standard Craig and Ford were more or less born into their roles and director Jon Favreau actually develops his characters and gives them things to do instead of posing them in front of special effects He lamented that the film was not a pure Western saying of the aliens T here is more genuine suspense when Percy Dolarhyde starts shooting up the town than when countless aliens appear Salon s Andrew O Hehir offered a mixed response claiming the film to be well made and clever and singling out Craig and Ford for their performances O Hehir was critical of the combination of western and science fiction elements calling it a mediocre western clumsily welded to a mediocre alien shoot em up Slant s Nick Schager reacted negatively stating Cowboys Aliens mashes up genres with a staunch dedication to getting everything wrong making sure that each scene is more inane than the one that preceded it giving the film one star out of four Schager continued Cowboys Aliens s western accoutrements are so false as to be stunning with every steely eyed glare from Craig s Man With No Memory every confrontation between his Jake and Ford s grizzled Dolarhyde and every silhouetted horseback ride across a sunset range seeming like a wan approximation of a familiar genre staple Favreau s visuals have an inauthentic and bland blockbuster sheen and his actors are similarly afflicted with a case of poseur itis Craig s affected silent type glowering Ford s gruff racism or Wilde s blank wide eyed stares failing to deliver a single believable line reading or gesture Accolades Cowboys Aliens received five nominations At the 39th Annie Awards the film was nominated in Animated Effects in a Live Action Production for both Gary Wu and Lee Uren but lost to Transformers Dark of the Moon The ceremony took place on February 4 2011 The film received nominations from the

lost to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 in both ceremonies Ford received a Saturn Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor Home media Cowboys Aliens was released on DVD and Blu ray Disc on December 6 2011 The release includes an extended version of the film running 135 minutes three behind the scenes featurettes and feature commentary with director Jon Favreau Infringement lawsuit On November 30 2011 Steven John Busti filed a lawsuit against Universal DreamWorks Platinum Studios and Scott Mitchell Rosenberg claiming copyright infringement Busti claimed he wrote a preview for his story Cowboys and Aliens in 1994 which was published in the April 1995 issue of Bizarre Fantasy 1 The story was also previewed in a 1995 issue of Comic Shop News which was on the same page that featured coverage of Scott Mitchell Rosenberg Rosenberg and Platinum produced a one sheet depicting a cowboy being chased by an alien which eventually led to Universal and DreamWorks buying film rights to their concept The lawsuit was dismissed Historical legend Although its name is not shown or mentioned the capsized steamboat that appears in the film is presumed to be the Iron Mountain which according to legend steamed out of Vicksburg towing two barges Two hours later another boat found the barges adrift The ship was not found until later having apparently been refloated by flood waters and carried through a break in a levee and grounded in a cotton field at Omega Landing near Tallulah Louisiana See also High Plains Invaders a 2009 alien western film References External links

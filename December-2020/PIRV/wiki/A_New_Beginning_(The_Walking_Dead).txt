Rick tries to get Maggie to agree to give supplies to the Sanctuary and help with repairing the bridge She asserts that she will only provide supplies if the Sanctuary supply half the workforce for the work on the bridge Maggie tells Rick that she s no longer following his way Before they leave Maggie has Gregory hanged while Rick and Michonne look on in horror Production A New Beginning represents the first episode of several changes to the series It is the first episode with Angela Kang as the showrunner taking over for Scott M Gimple who will oversee the Walking Dead franchise for AMC It also represents the last season for Andrew Lincoln as Rick Grimes who had announced his departure from the show earlier in 2018 To facilitate this several elements of A New Beginning are designed to accommodate Lincoln s departure According to Kang they continued the hostility between Rick and Maggie over differences of how Rick saved Negan s life and expanding that to some of Rick s other closer allies Thus the washed out bridge that must be fixed and serves as a plot element for several more episodes was envisioned as a literal representation of the bridge that Rick needs to make to his friends and allies to keep the various communities working together according to Kang The episode includes the death of main character Gregory played by Xander Berkeley Prior to season 9 Berkeley said that there had been some long term plan for Gregory s death stating that There s only so long a douchebag like Gregory can stay alive With season 9 s change in showrunner alongside the changes necessary to accommodate the departure of Lincoln and the limited schedule of Lauren Cohan Berkeley learned his character s death had been pushed up much sooner which he learned nearly last minute Berkeley had no qualms about the change and considered that being hanged would add to his actor s portfolio of deaths from previous works Gregory s death was adapted from the comic book in issue 141 where Gregory similarly plotted for Maggie s death due to being ousted as Hilltop s leader and Maggie opted to hang him as punishment Filming of the museum scenes primarily took place at the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta across two days The production team created a fake glass floor made of plexiglass to use at the base of the building s staircase for some of the scenes The episode was dedicated to memory of Scott Wilson the actor for Hershel Greene on the series Wilson died on October 6 2018 shortly after news earlier that day that he had already reprised his role of Hershel for season 9 Reception Critical reception A New Beginning received critical acclaim from critics On Rotten Tomatoes the episode has an approval rating of 96 with an average score of 7 22 out of 10 based

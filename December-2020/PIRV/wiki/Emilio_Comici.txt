500 metres 1 600 ft near Trieste He began climbing at the suggestion of friends from the Trieste chapter of the Italian Alpine Club gaining his first experience in the nearby Val Rosandra In 1932

served as podest mayor of S lva in Val Gardena where he also directed the ski school He was a supporter of the Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini which promoted him by sending him on lecture tours He died in an accidental fall caused by a frayed rope on the training cliffs of the S lva climbing area in Val Gardena For a long time the precise circumstances were not reported by the Fascist authorities who did not want to cast a shadow on the famous figure of Comici In addition to his talents as a climber Comici is remembered for his aesthetic concept of climbing perceiving it as a means of self expression through harmonious movement It was Comici who originated the concept of climbing direttissima routes following the path a drop of water would take down the mountain Comici s book Alpinismo Eroico employs rhetoric characteristic of the era in which it was written The Rifugio Zsigmondy Comici or Zsigmondyh tte in the Sexten Dolomites is named for Comici and Emil Zsigmondy The

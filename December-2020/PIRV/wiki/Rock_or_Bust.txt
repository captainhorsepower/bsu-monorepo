the same day We ve only become aware of Phil s arrest as the news was breaking We have no further comment Phil s absence will not affect the release of our new album Rock or Bust and upcoming tour next year It was not yet clear whether Rudd would remain with the band or not or who might be his replacement The attempted procurement charge against Rudd was dropped the following day charges of possession of methamphetamine and possession of cannabis and a charge of threatening to kill remained Recording The album was recorded at Warehouse Studio in Vancouver Canada with producer Brendan O Brien and mixer Mike Fraser When Rudd was ten days late for the recording sessions O Brien was ready to replace him with another drummer but Rudd arrived and recorded his parts By Angus Young s reckoning recording took about four weeks We had all the material we were well prepared to do the album and that helped a lot We d done a lot of the work before going in the studio Brendan is a very accomplished musician so that s part of why we work with him He knows all his instruments The songs were constructed largely by Angus Young from material accumulated by the brothers during the recording of previous albums On some lead tracks Angus Young used the Schaffer Replica a device that emulates the Schaffer Vega Diversity System The device was donated to him by AC DC fan Fil SoloDallas Olivieri Release and promotion Josh Cheuse of the Arcade Creative Group handled the art direction and decided to add more features to the physical edition considering that If you don t make something special there s no point in even making any packaging at all Thus the cover is a lenticular and the booklet has 24 pictures featuring the band The agency Curb did a special video to promote the album in a Polish quarry where a rock exploded to reveal a carved AC DC logo The first single Play Ball was first used on 27 September 2014 in a trailer for Major League Baseball on TBS postseason coverage and the single was released on 7 October the same day as the track listing and artwork were revealed It became available on iTunes for those who pre ordered the album The second single is

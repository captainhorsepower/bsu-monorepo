usually late at night or in the early morning To avoid identification he would attack and then rape his victims from behind ensuring that they would only get glimpses of him In three instances he videotaped his victims and threatened to publish the tape on the Internet or give it to their friends if they reported the crime Afterwards Sela forced his victims to shower to reduce physical evidence and threatened to kill them if they left the shower before half an hour had passed Sela s rape spree gained notoriety and he became known as the Tel Aviv rapist In 1995 he was arrested and sentenced to two years in prison for having systematically molested his cousin from the time she was eight to when she was fifteen While awaiting trial Sela made an attempt to escape Despite having refused psychological treatment and at least one psychologist warning that he was still a danger to the public Sela was released on parole for good behaviour six months early He then resumed his rape spree Capture Sela was arrested in Tel Aviv on December 14 1999 by police responding to reports of an attack on a young woman and an eight year old girl Police noted that Sela s appearance matched descriptions of the Tel Aviv rapist and during an investigation of his criminal record it was noted that the Tel Aviv rapes had stopped while he was in prison Detectives then took a DNA sample which matched samples given by nine of the victims Sela was indicted on 14 counts of rape and under a plea bargain was sentenced to 35 years imprisonment Escape and recapture On November 24 2006 Sela escaped while being transferred to a court hearing During his time on the run he broke into a home in Pardes Hanna Karkur and stole money documents valuables credit cards and a key He also stole a car After an intensive search and a tip from a relative whom Sela had visited he was recaptured on December 8 near kibbutz Lohamei HaGeta ot There was controversy after pictures emerged of officers abusing and humiliating Sela after his capture He was sentenced to an additional 4 years in prison for offences committed during his escape Life in prison Sela was first incarcerated at Eshel Prison in Beersheba He was allegedly stabbed twice in the back by prisoners while imprisoned there although the Israel Prison Service denied it Following his escape and recapture he was transferred to Rimonim Prison in Even Yehuda where he was placed in solitary confinement in the National Isolation Unit an ultra high security six cell wing of the prison used to house some of the most notorious criminals in Israel He was later transferred to HaSharon Prison near Tel Mond and then to Nitzan Prison in Ramla where he is currently incarcerated While imprisoned Sela filed dozens of court motions every year most of which focused on inconsequential issues and were rejected Due to his persistent motions he became known as a serial appellant The repeated motions put a burden on the authorities as the Israel Prison Service was tasked with bringing him to each hearing and returning him to prison a process that necessitated the presence of police and massive security due to Sela being considered a high escape risk On August 14 2011 the Beersheba District Court limited Sela to eight motions per year and imposed a NIS 70 fine on him for every motion rejected Judge Shlomo Friedlander said that the decision was to prevent authorities from spending an unequal share of their resources on his appeals which could deny other prisoners their rights In 2010 Sela exposed himself to a female guard during his daily walk in the prison yard and was placed in solitary confinement In May 2011 Sela s mother Rivka was caught attempting to smuggle him pornographic CDs in a file she had claimed

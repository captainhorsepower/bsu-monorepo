coordinator during the 2007 season Billick had assumed those duties early in the 2006 season after firing Jim Fassel although Rick Neuheisel had been listed on the coaching staff in that capacity addressing this position was as much of a priority for new Head Coach John Harbaugh as it was for owner Steve Bisciotti to find a new Head Coach for his team at the time Recently dismissed as head coach from the Miami Dolphins Malcolm Cam Cameron was highly sought after for his offensive expertise from his time in San Diego with the Chargers After some deliberation amongst offers he received from around the league Cameron chose to come to the Ravens and John Harbaugh announced him as the offensive coordinator on January 23 2008 Rex Ryan was released from duty as the team s defensive coordinator but was still under contract to the Ravens as a defensive coordinator in name for one more year should new Head Coach John Harbaugh decide to hire him onto his staff thus making him ineligible to accept the same position with any other NFL football team Ryan at the time was applying for a head coaching position himself but got no offers for any of the four head coaching vacancies in Atlanta his own team in Baltimore Miami or in Washington On January 28 2008 Ryan was re hired as the Ravens Defensive Coordinator and was subsequently promoted to Assistant Head Coach Defensive Coordinator after rumors of potential Redskins Head Coach Jim Zorn circulated that he wanted Ryan to coach the Redskins as its defensive coordinator Personnel Offseason Free agency During the 2008 free agency period the Ravens acquired linebacker Brendan Ayanbadejo from the Chicago Bears and cornerback Frank Walker from the Green Bay Packers Both were added to the Ravens roster primarily for

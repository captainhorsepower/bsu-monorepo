Sleepwalker (The Kinks album)
Sleepwalker is the sixteenth studio album by the English rock group the Kinks released in 1977 It marked a return to straight ahead self contained rock songs after several years of concept albums It is the first album in what critics usually call the arena rock phase of the group in which more commercial and mainstream production techniques would be employed The album also marks the last appearance of bassist John Dalton who left the band during the recording sessions Dalton plays bass on all songs on the album save for Mr Big Man The lineup of the Kinks would be trimmed down significantly in 1977 following the album s release as the brass section and backup singers were removed and the band returned to a standard rock band outfit It was their first album for the Arista label Background Despite their success with the hit singles Lola and Apeman in 1970 the Kinks had less and less commercial success throughout the 1970s largely attributed to bandleader Ray Davies s shift toward concept albums and a theatrical sound for the band After the release of the band s more rock oriented 1975 album Schoolboys in Disgrace the Kinks switched labels from RCA Records to Clive Davis Arista Records signaling a transition toward less theatrical material Following the band s signing to Arista plans for a new album began to emerge Just prior to the album s recording the band s Konk Studios was equipped with a new 24 track recorder Davies said to Melody Maker in 1976 of the then upcoming recording sessions for a new Kinks album Yes I am looking forward to it because the situation is right It s a great studio I m proud of it Recording Beginning in May 1976 the band began rehearsing new material up to thirty new tracks Ray Davies had penned with twenty songs attempted by the band Rejected song titles included Power of Gold Stagefright Restless and Elevator Man the latter being used by Ray Davies on the 1994 EP Waterloo Sunset 94 Throughout July 1976 recordings of multiple songs were recorded though most were rejected including the album s Juke Box Music Life on the Road and Brother future follow up album Misfits Hay Fever and In a Foreign Land B sides Prince of the Punks and Artificial Light flipsides to Father Christmas and A Rock n Roll Fantasy respectively and the rejected Back to 64 Decade Lazy Day and The Poseur the latter released on the CD reissue of the album In September more songs for the album were recorded including Full Moon Sleepwalker Sleepless Night and Life Goes On Rejects Child Bride Everything Is Alright One Woman Man and On the Outside the latter appearing both on the CD reissue of Sleepwalker and in another form on Waterloo Sunset 94 were also made In October new versions of Juke Box Music and Life on the Road were recorded as well as the new Stormy Sky Another Misfits song Black Messiah was also attempted but was held off the album During this time longtime bassist John Dalton left the band citing his lack of family time the stresses of the road and low pay as reasons Overdubs by the remaining four piece were added throughout the rest of October and November To replace Dalton ex Blodwyn Pig bassist Andy Pyle was added to the group The band then recorded Mr Big Man in December which when added to the album s running order replaced In a Foreign Land Release and reception Sleepwalker was released during February 1977 in both the US and UK Although the album like all Kinks albums since 1967 s Something Else by The Kinks failed to chart in the UK the album proved to be a success in the US reaching 21 on the Billboard 200 That following March the title track of the album backed with Full Moon reached 48 in the US becoming the first Kinks single to reach the Billboard Hot 100 since Apeman in 1970 Its follow up single Juke Box Music failed to make an impact Although Clive Davis had originally pushed for Brother to be released as a single comparing its appeal to that of Simon and Garfunkel s Bridge over Troubled Water it never saw an official single release Critical reaction to the album was generally positive an improvement on the band s previous reception during their theatrical incarnation Sleepwalker was lauded by Billy Altman of Rolling Stone who said The Kinks playing on Sleepwalker is easily their most powerful since Lola In the UK Allan Jones in Melody Maker praised the album saying that Sleepwalker emphatically testifies to the dramatic artistic revival of Raymond Douglas Davies whose supreme talents as a writer have been so distressingly overlooked during the first half of the 1970s Sleepwalker really is the group s strongest and most organised album in years Giovanni Dadomo of Sounds was less approving saying it s not the great new album one always hopes for Track

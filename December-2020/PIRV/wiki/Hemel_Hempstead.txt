Hemel Hempstead
Hemel Hempstead is a large town which was originally developed as a new town It is in Hertfordshire England Located 24 miles 39 km northwest of London it is part of the Greater London Urban Area The population according to the 2001 Census was 81 143 and at the 2011 census was 97 500 Developed after the Second World War as a new town it has existed as a settlement since the 8th century and was granted its town charter by King Henry VIII in 1539 It is part of the district and borough since 1984 of Dacorum and the Hemel Hempstead constituency Nearby towns are Watford St Albans Hatfield and Berkhamsted History Origin of the name The settlement was called by the name Henamsted or Hean Hempsted in Anglo Saxon times and in William the Conqueror s time by the name of Hemel Amstede The name is referred to in the Domesday Book as Hamelamestede but in later centuries it became Hamelhamsted and possibly Hemlamstede In Old English stead or stede simply meant place reflected in German Stadt and Dutch stede or stad meaning city or town such as the site of a building or pasture as in clearing in the woods and this suffix is used in the names of other English places such as Hamstead and Berkhamsted It is theoretically possible for a previous name to have become corrupted to something very similar to Hempstead and that Hemel originated as a way of specifying Hemel Hempstead as opposed to nearby Berkhamsted Hemel is reflected in the German Himmel and Dutch Hemel both of which mean heaven or sky so it could be that Hemel Hempstead was in a less forested area open to the sky while Berkhamsted which could mean birch reflected in the Dutch berk was in a forest of birch trees Another opinion is that Hemel came from Haemele the name of the district in the 8th century and is most likely either the name of the landowner or meant broken country The town is now known to locals as Hemel However before the Second World War locals called it Hempstead Emigrants from Hemel Hempstead led by one John Carman migrated to the American colonies in the early 17th century and founded the town of Hempstead New York in 1644 Early history The first recorded mention of the town is the grant of land at Hamaele by Offa King of Essex to the Saxon Bishop of London in AD 705 Hemel Hempstead on its present site is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as a vill Hamelhamstede with about 100 inhabitants The parish church of St Mary s was built in 1140 and is recognised as one of the finest Norman parish churches in the county The church features an unusual 200 foot tall 61 m spire added in the 12th century one of Europe s tallest After the Norman conquest Robert Count of Mortain the elder half brother of William the Conqueror was granted lands associated with Berkhamsted Castle which included Hemel Hempstead The estates passed through several hands over the next few centuries including Thomas Becket in 1162 Hemel Hempstead was in the Domesday hundred of Danais Daneys i e Danish which by 1200 had been combined with the hundred of Tring to form the hundred of Dacorum which maintained its court into the 19th century In 1290 King John s grandson the Earl of Cornwall gave the manor to the religious order of the Bonhommes when he endowed the monastery at Ashridge The town remained part of the monastery s estates until the Reformation and break up of Ashridge in 1539 In that same year the town was granted a royal charter by Henry VIII to become a bailiwick with the right to hold a Thursday market and a fair on Corpus Christi Day The first bailiff of Hemel Hempstead was William Stephyns 29 December 1539 Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn are reputed to have stayed in the town at this time In 1953 a collection of unusually fine medieval wall paintings dating between 1470 and 1500 were discovered in a cottage in Piccotts End a village on the outskirts of Hemel Hempstead This same building had been converted into the first cottage hospital providing free medical services by Sir Astley Cooper in 1827 In 1581 a group of local people acquired lands now referred to as Boxmoor from the Earl of Leicester to prevent their enclosure These were transferred to trustees in 1594 These have been used for public grazing and they are administered by the Box Moor Trust Remains of Roman villa farming settlements have been found at Boxmoor and Gadebridge which span the entire period of Roman Britain A well preserved Roman burial mound is located in Highfield 18th to mid 20th century In the 18th and 19th centuries Hemel Hempstead was an agricultural market town Wealthy landowners built a few large country houses in the locality including The Bury built in 1790 and Gadebridge House erected by the noted surgeon and anatomist Sir Astley Cooper in 1811 As the Industrial Revolution gained momentum commercial travel between the Midlands and London increased greatly Hemel Hempstead was located on a direct route between these areas of industry and commerce and this made it a natural waypoint for trade and travel between the two Initially the Sparrows Herne Turnpike Road was opened in 1762 It attracted a lot of traffic that resulted in its surface wearing out quickly and it became notorious for its ruts and potholes In 1793 construction began on the Grand Junction Canal a major project to provide a freight waterway between the Midlands and the Port of London In 1798 the canal from the Thames reached Two Waters just south of Hemel Hempstead and opened fully in 1805 Hemel s position on the commercial transport network was established further in 1837 when the route of the new London and Birmingham Railway reached the town The line s construction had been delayed for several years by vigorous lobbying by a number of powerful local landowners including Sir Astley Cooper of Gadebridge House who were all keen to protect their estates from invasion by the iron horse Their campaign was successful and the main line was routed along the River Bulbourne instead of the River Gade skirting around the edge of Hemel Hempstead As a result the railway station serving Hemel Hempstead was built one mile outside the town centre at Boxmoor Boxmoor and Hemel Hempstead railway station today s Hemel Hempstead railway station opened in 1837 The railways continued to expand and in 1877 a new route opened connecting Boxmoor to the Midland Railway at Harpenden The Harpenden to Hemel Hempstead branch railway affectionately known as the Nickey Line crossed the town centre on a long curved viaduct eventually serving three local stations in the town at Heath Park Halt Hemel Hempsted Midland and Godwin s Halt Despite the incursion of various forms of transport Hemel remained principally an agricultural market town throughout the 19th century In the last decades of that century development of houses and villas for London commuters began Hemel steadily expanded but only became a borough on 13 July 1898 During the Second World War ninety high explosive bombs were dropped on the town by the Luftwaffe The most notorious incident was on 10 May 1942 when a stick of bombs demolished houses at Nash Mills killing eight people The nearby John Dickinson Co factories which were used to produce munitions were the target New town After the Second World War in 1946 the government designated Hemel Hempstead as the site of one of its proposed new towns designed to house the population displaced by the London Blitz since slums and bombsites were being cleared in London On 4 February 1947 the Government purchased 5 910 acres 23 9 km2 of land and began work on the New Town The first new residents moved in during April 1949 and the town continued its planned expansion through to the end of the 1980s Hemel grew to its present population of 80 000 with new developments enveloping the original town on all sides The original part of Hemel is still known as the Old Town Hemel Hempstead was announced as candidate No 3 for a New Town in July 1946 in accordance with the government s policy for the decentralisation of persons and industry from London Initially there was much resistance and hostility to the plan from locals especially when it was revealed that any development would be carried out not by the local council but by a newly appointed government body the Hemel Hempstead Development Corporation later amalgamated with similar bodies to form the Commission for New Towns However following a public inquiry the following year the town got the go ahead Hemel officially became a New Town on 4 February 1947 The initial plans for the New Town were drawn up by architect Geoffrey Jellicoe His view of Hemel Hempstead he said was not a city in a garden but a city in a park However the plans were not well received by most locals Revised and less radical plans were drawn up and the first developments proceeded despite local protests in July 1948 The first area to be developed was Adeyfield At this time the plans for a revolutionary double roundabout at Moor End were first put forward but in fact it was not until 1973 that the roundabout was opened as it was originally designed It was quickly christened The Magic Roundabout by locals echoing the name of the children s TV show The first houses erected as part of the New Town plan were in Longlands Adeyfield and went up in the spring of 1949 The first new residents moved in early 1950 At this time work started on building new factories and industrial areas to avoid the town becoming a dormitory town The first factory was erected in 1950 in Maylands Avenue As building progressed with continuing local opposition the town was becoming increasingly popular with those moving in from areas of north London By the end of 1951 there was a waiting list of about 10 000 wishing to move to Hemel The neighbourhoods of Bennett s End Chaulden and Warner s End were started The Queen paid a visit shortly after her accession in 1952 and laid a foundation stone for a new church in Adeyfield one of her first public engagements as Queen The shopping square she visited is named Queen s Square and the nearby area has street names commemorating the then recent conquest of Everest such as Hillary and Tenzing Roads This conquest is also celebrated in the name of a pub in Warners End the Top of the World The redevelopment of the town centre was started in 1952 with a new centre based on Marlowes south of the old town This was alongside a green area called the Water Gardens designed by Jellicoe formed by ponding back the River Gade The old centre of the High Street was to remain largely undeveloped though the market square closed and was replaced by a much larger one in the new centre The former private estate of Gadebridge was opened up as a public park New schools and roads were built to serve the expanding new neighbourhoods New housing technology such as prefabrication started to be used from the mid 50s and house building rates increased dramatically Highfield was the next neighbourhood to be constructed The M1 motorway opened to the east in 1959 and a new road connecting it to the town was opened By 1962 the redevelopment of the new town as originally envisaged was largely complete though further expansion plans were then put forward The nearby United States Air Force base of Bovingdon which had served as the town s de facto airport reverted to RAF use at this time continuing as an active military airfield until 1971 A campus of West Herts College the library new police station and the Pavilion theatre and music venue were all built during the 1960s The town seemed to attract its fair share of celebrity openings with shops and businesses opened by Frankie Vaughan Benny Hill Terry Thomas and the new cinema was opened by Hollywood star Lauren Bacall The last of the originally planned neighbourhoods Grovehill began construction in 1967 However further neighbourhoods of Woodhall Farm and Fields End were later built as part of the extended plans Like other first generation new towns Hemel is divided into residential neighbourhoods each with their own village centre with shops pubs and services Each neighbourhood is designed around a few major feeder roads with many smaller cul de sacs and crescents intended to minimise traffic and noise nuisance In keeping with the optimism of the early post war years much of the town features modernist architecture with many unusual and experimental designs for housing Not all of these have stood the test of time A significant issue was how to choose names for all the new roads Many areas of the new town used themes e g fields birds rivers poets explorers leaders etc In 1974 the government abolished the Borough of Hemel Hempstead and the town was incorporated into Dacorum District along with Tring and Berkhamsted The first chairman of that council was chairman John Johnson 1913 1977 In the 1980s Dacorum District Council successfully lobbied to be recognised as the successor for the Royal Charter establishing the Borough of Hemel Hempstead and thus regained the Mayor and its Aldermen and became Dacorum Borough At the 2001 census Hemel Hempstead was the most populated urban area in Hertfordshire narrowly more populated than its traditionally larger rival Watford Geography Hemel Hempstead grew up in a shallow chalkland valley at the confluence of the rivers Gade and Bulbourne 27 miles 43 km northwest of central London The New Town expansion took place up the valley sides and onto the plateau above the original Old Town To the north and west lie mixed farm and woodland with scattered villages part of the Chiltern Hills To the west lies Berkhamsted The River Bulbourne flows along the south western edge of the town through Boxmoor To the south lie Watford and the beginnings of the Greater London conurbation To the east lies St Albans a historic cathedral and market town and now like Hemel Hempstead part of the London commuter belt Possibly the best view of Hemel Hempstead in its physical setting is from the top of Roughdown Common a chalk hill to the south of the town at TL 049 055 Districts The grand design for Hemel Hempstead new town saw each new district centred around a parade or square of shops called a neighbourhood centre Other districts existed before the new town as suburbs villages and industrial centres and were incorporated into the town Adeyfield Located on a hill to the east of the Old Town this was the first of the New Town districts to be started The first four families of Hemel Hempstead s new town moved into their homes in Adeyfield on Wednesday 8 February 1950 Apsley a 19th century mill town a mile south of Old Hemel which grew up around the paper making industry notably the John Dickinson Co mills Now a suburb of Hemel with many warehouse outlets set in retail parks a large office facility for Hertfordshire County Council and a large Sainsbury s supermarket Bennetts End Located on the rising ground to the south east and another original district of the new town Construction began in 1951 and by autumn 1952 300 houses were occupied Boxmoor A mostly Victorian era developed district

building on land to the east of Hemel Hempstead near the M1 motorway This would comprise 2 500 new homes The land is within St Albans planning jurisdiction but would have a major impact on Hemel services which has been quite controversial West Hemel Land to the west of Chaulden and Warners End has been removed from the Green Belt designation and is due for development with 900 new homes Commerce industry and agriculture Historical Historically the area was agricultural and was noted for its rich cereal production The agricultural journalist William Cobbett noted of Hemel Hempstead in 1822 that the land along here is very fine a red tenacious flinty loam upon a bed of chalk at a yard or two beneath which in my opinion is the very best corn land that we have in England By the 18th century the grain market in Hemel was one of the largest in the country In 1797 there were 11 watermills working in the vicinity of the town The chalk on which Hemel is largely built has had commercial value and has been mined and exploited to improve farmland and for building from the 18th century In the Highbarns area now residential there was a collapse in 2007 of a section of old chalk workings and geological studies have been undertaken to show the extent of these workings In the 19th century Hemel Hempstead was a noted brickmaking paper manufacturing and straw plaiting centre In later 19th and early 20th centuries Hemel was also a noted watercress growing area supplying 1 16 of the country s national demand following development of the New Town the watercress growing moved to nearby Berkhamsted and Tring The cress beds were redeveloped as the modern day Water Gardens Joseph Cranstone s engineering company was founded in 1798 and was responsible for much of the early street lighting in the town as well as it first gasworks It became the Hemel Hempstead Engineering Company and stayed in business until the Second World War In 1867 Cranstone s son built a steam powered coach which he drove to London but which was destroyed in a crash on the return journey A local Boxmoor pub commemorates the event In 1803 the first automatic papermaking machinery was developed in Hemel by the Fourdrinier brothers at Frogmore Paper making expanded in the vicinity in the early 19th century and grew into the huge John Dickinson Co mills in the 20th A traditional employer in the area was also Brock s manufacturer of fireworks The factory was a significant employer since well before the Second World War and remained in production until the mid 1970s The present day neighbourhood of Woodhall Farm was subsequently built on the site From 1967 to 1983 it was home to one of the most remarkable newspaper experiments of recent times when the Thomson Organisation launched the Hemel Hempstead Evening Post Echo This comprised two evening papers the Evening Echo and the Evening Post and was based at a modern headquarters in Mark Road which had previously been used as a hot water bottle factory The dual operation was conceived by Lord Thomson of Fleet to take on the Northcliffe and Beaverbrook domination of the London evening paper market and tap into what he saw as a major source of consumer advertising The papers were remarkable not only for technological innovation but also journalistic excellence Both the Evening Echo and Evening Post won design awards during the late 1960s and early 1970s but it was the Evening Echo that took the major writing honours with John Marquis being voted Provincial Journalist of the Year in 1974 and Melanie Phillips being named Young Journalist of the Year in 1975 Many outstanding journalists worked on both papers during their heyday with several going on to be editors and leading Fleet Street figures Unfortunately the operation fell victim to the freesheet revolution of the 1980s the titles closing in 1983 with the loss of 470 jobs Significant historic local firms include Addressograph address labels and labelling systems Apple Computer s UK operations were originally based in Hemel though they moved to much larger premises in Uxbridge during the late 1980s British Petroleum Brocks

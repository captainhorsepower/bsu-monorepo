Guest Cyril Appleton as Police Driver Production Development The film was based on the novel Touch the Lion s Paw published in 1975 The New York Times said The book has a lot to offer if only for the planning of the caper In 1977 it was announced Burt Reynolds would star in a film of the book called Rough Cut based on a script by Larry Gelbart produced by David Merrick and directed by Blake Edwards Reynolds and Merrick had worked together on Semi Tough and Merrick asked the actor what sort of film he would like to do Reynolds wanted to do a homage to Cary Grant Even if it didnt turn out well I d get to throw away my Levis and cowboy hat and wear some decent clothes for a change the actor said Gelbart said when he came on to the film another writer had already done a script and Merrick hired him at the request of Reynolds who had writer and director approval and was an admirer of Gelbart s My favourite writers have always come out of TV said Reynolds They don t usually have ego problems and they re used to writing under the gun Gelbart wrote a draft of the script which Reynolds called brilliant but Blake Edwards did not like it and Gelbart was fired off the project in February 1978 Then Edwards left the project Gelbart says Reynolds wanted to push back production of the film to do Starting Over and Merrick agreed provided Reynolds give up writer and director approval This was done I hope it was worth it said Reynolds but I knew Starting Over would be important for me Merrick hired four other writers to work on the film Then at Reynolds behest Gelbart was rehired in June 1979 He did three more drafts in collaboration with Reynolds and new director Don Siegel Siegel agreed to do the film because he was afraid of being typecast as an action director I thought I d have a ball he said Shooting Filming began in London in August 1979 Siegel said at the time If I d known Escape to Alcatraz was going to be such a success I don t think I d have done this picture But because I love England I thought I d have a go But it s been a disaster since day one Siegel said the original book was poor and we ve had at least seven writers on it It s not nearly as good as it should be and a great deal of work is needed to shore it up Siegel said this picture is as big a departure for Reynolds as it is for me It s more in the genre of a Cary Grant movie Frankly I don t understand why Burt took this picture He knew it needed a great deal of work Merrick and Don are constantly running into each other said Reynolds Every day I wonder what ll happen when those two meet This is the worst prepared movie I ve been involved with said Siegel It ll take a miracle to bring it off And unless Merrick helps us that miracle will be an impossibility I don t agree with that said Reynolds Of course he hasn t made as many bad pictures as I have I ve had experiences that make this one look like Gone with the Wind Siegel was also unhappy with the title Rough Cut claiming that it would cause critics to make jokes about the film being a rough cut He pressed for Jack of Diamonds to be used instead but Merrick refused Firing of Siegel Merrick fired Siegel several weeks into filming and hired British filmmaker Peter R Hunt Reynolds an admirer of Siegel was extremely unhappy with this Blake Edwards flew in to discuss taking over but wanted to rewrite the script Eventually Reynolds helped persuade Merrick to rehire Siegel I ve done more in three days than Henry Kissinger did in three years said Reynolds adding that I ll never get myself in a situation like this again Lesley Anne Down called it an interesting time Anthony Shaffer was brought in to work on the script Siegel did say he felt Reynolds was marvelous extremely inventive Endings Just before the film unit went to Hawaii to shoot the ending Reynolds asked Gelbart to write a new ending as a personal favor Merrick refused to pay the writer Gelbart did so It wasn t easy he said because the film had changed so much I was writing the tail without having seen the donkey The new ending was shot However the filmmakers were still dissatisfied Gelbart suggested another ending after seeing the film which Siegel agreed with Merrick did not want this but Siegel insisted and he had final cut Siegel filmed three different endings which Merrick refused to use instead hiring another director Robert Ellis Miller to tack on his preferred ending According to Siegel s wife Carol who also worked on the film Merrick would agree to shoot sequences then change his mind then go back and agree to put them back in annoying cast and crew Merrick used a rough cut of the film as collateral to raise money for his famed Broadway production of 42nd Street David Niven Lawsuit David Niven later sued Merrick for 1 791 000 claiming his likeness was not used in advertisements and publicity He also said Merrick owed him 91 000 In my 46 years as an actor in more than 80 films said Niven this is the first time I have ever been involved in a lawsuit I have always lived up to my contractual obligations and have always paid my debts David Merrick and Paramount have neither lived up to their contract with me nor honored their debt to me Release and reception Gelbart quipped as someone once said all you ve got to do with a Burt Reynolds picture is keep it in focus and it s bound to make you 50 million However the film proved to be a box office disappointment Roger Ebert gave the film 2 5 stars out of 4 and wrote It s fun it s slick and it s carefully put together but it s more of an exercise than an accomplishment Everyone does their schtick the plot complications unfold like clockwork but we find ourselves not really caring Variety declared Miraculously all of the production difficulty does not result in a disjointed feeling in the picture Problem instead seems to lie in much of the dialog which comes across as wooden and contrived Reynolds and Down do what they can to keep things going but their attempts at witty banter never appear natural Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote Once the movie gets into the caper itself which occupies the last quarter of the picture Rough Cut suddenly acquires its identity as an action film but it s nearly too late By then we re on the point of losing interest It s all that dreadful dialogue Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times stated At its least Rough Cut is a sleek and featherweight care lifter At its best it almost works as a caper to compare with the best of a genre Larry Kart of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three stars out of four and called it one of the most quirkily fascinating films to come along in some time Gary Arnold of The Washington Post called the film all too aptly titled explaining that its principal flaws are Don Siegel s stiff jointed direction and a lackluster plot I felt the picture was meant to be a parody but I don t think it s broad enough said Reynolds It went for something subtle that might have been too subtle I really don t think it s clear enough and it could have been a lot better Compared to At Long Last Love it s just a masterpiece You have to look at these things in perspective after all References External links Rough Cut on IMDb Rough Cut at AllMovie Rough Cut at Rotten Tomatoes

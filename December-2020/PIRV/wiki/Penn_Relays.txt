Penn Relays
The Penn Relays also Penn Relays Carnival is the oldest and largest track and field competition in the United States hosted annually since April 21 1895 by the University of Pennsylvania at Franklin Field in Philadelphia In 2012 there were 116 events run at the meet and more athletes run in the Penn Relays than do any other track and field meet in the world It regularly attracts more than 15 000 participants from high schools colleges and track clubs throughout North America and abroad notably Jamaica competing in more than 300 events over five days Historically the event has been credited with popularizing the running of relay races It is held during the last full week in April ending on the last Saturday in April Attendance typically tops 100 000 over the final three days and has been known to surpass 50 000 on Saturday The Penn Relays also holds a Catholic Youth Organization night for Catholic Middle Schools in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia Preliminaries are run on the Tuesday during Carnival Week and the Finals are run on Friday History When the University of Pennsylvania Track and Field committee wanted to add a little bit more excitement to their 1893 spring handicapped meet they came up with the idea of running a relay race at the meet The team would consist of four men all running a quarter of a mile one after the other Today this relay race is known as the 4 400 m relay The sport of relay running was still fairly new at the time of the first Penn Relays two years old to be exact During the 1893 spring handicapped track meet the University of Pennsylvania and Princeton University men ran a relay race against each other The Princeton men won with a time of 3 34 beating the University of Pennsylvania Penn by 8 yards The Penn Relays impacted the history of the sport of relay racing and helped it become as popular as it is today The first Penn Relay Carnival The first ever Penn Relay Carnival was held on April 21 1895 at Franklin Field and was a huge success Approximately 5 000 people attended the meet Nine relay races were run and only two teams were in each race four of which were high school and prep school races Another four were college races and one championship college race The only relay run at that time was the 4x400 yard relay or the mile relay The first team to win a Penn Relays championship was Harvard University after they defeated University of Pennsylvania with a time of 3 34 Other colleges that competed in the meet were Cornell University Columbia University Lafayette Lehigh Rutgers Swarthmore City College of New York and New York University Growth of the meet The number of entries from the first Penn Relay Carnival to the second Penn Relay Carnival quadrupled Because of this a time schedule of events had to be made to keep the meet organized A rule was established that if a team was not on time to their race the race would be run without them In that same year a 5 mile relay was added to the meet which would later become the 4 mile relay The next year in 1897 the 2 mile relay or the 4 800 m relay was added to the meet In 1898 The University of Chicago became the first midwestern team to attend the carnival In the two years after that the following events were added to the meet 100 yard dash 220 yard dash 120 yard hurdles the high jump pole vault long jump shot put and hammer throw The Term Carnival was put into the name of the meet in 1910 because of the carnival like atmosphere created by the carnival like tent camp at the meet Also in 1910 the Intercollegiate Association of Amateur Athletes of America created The Relay Racing Code The Code created a 20 foot area in front of the starting line in which a touch off between legs or runners of the relay could be made This rule would later become the rule for the exchange zone or the 20 meter zone 10 meters in front of the finish line 10 meters behind the finish line in which a baton can be passed from one leg of a relay to another At that time there was no such thing as batons or exchange zones that are used in present day relay racing instead runners would stand on the starting line and wait for the runner before them to touch their hand At the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm exchange zones were used for the first time In 1913 at the Penn Relay Carnival the baton was used for the first time Zones and batons made exchanges from one leg of the relay to the next much more efficient and would eventually make relay times much faster At the 1911 Penn Relay Carnival the college and high school championship events became known as the Championship of America races Ten years later the NCAA hosted the first college championship meet but before then the Penn Relays was thought to be the national championship meet In 1914 Oxford University turned the Penn Relay Carnival into an international event becoming the first team outside of the United States to compete That year Oxford won the 4 mile relay The 1915 Penn Relay Carnival took place over two days instead of just one like it had in the years before That same year the sprint medley relay 200m 200m 400m 800m and the distance medley relay 1200m 400m 800m 1600m were added to the meet At the 1926 Carnival the championship event of the shuttle hurdle relay Shuttle hurdle relay was added to the Penn Relays events at the suggestion Lord Burghley UK s Olympic hurdler Around that same time the loudspeaker was added to the stadium which helped inform the spectators of the events on the track Before the loudspeaker announcers used megaphones to inform spectators In an effort to gain more participants in the relays six new lanes were added to the inside of the track This renovation allowed for more athletes to compete in the spinning events That same year the northwest corner of the stadium that used to be used as the finishing chute was now used for the paddock area or the area were athletes were lined up and organized before their race In the 1950s the schedule of events was changed around so that the more popular events were run on Saturday afternoon The Carnival continued to grow as the years went on In 1956 the number of spectators reacher over 35 000 people for the first time and 4 000 athletes competed Then in 1958 43 618 people attended the meet In 1962 women competed for the first time in the 100 yard dash Two years later the high school girls 440 yard relays was added to the carnival That same year Jamaican high schools started to compete in the meet The Marathon was added to the Carnival in 1973 The next year distance events were moved on the schedule of events to be run on Thursday night after the second day of the decathlon Then in 1976 the events were converted into meters instead of yards except for the mile and the 4x120 yard shuttle hurdle relay A year later automatic timing was used for results instead of hand timing The carnival turned into a three day meet in 1978 because of the addition of more women s relays The Penn Relay Carnival did not only grow in the number of spectators participants and events it also started to grow financially In 1988 the carnival used corporate sponsorship instead of just earning money from tickets sold at the door like it had in the years before In the years that followed the crowd and number of participants gradually increased and the carnival would become nationally and internationally more popular The 2010 Relays featured a USA vs The World program pitting American teams against elite runners including Usain Bolt Shelly Ann Fraser and Alfred Kirwa Yego The event broke all previous attendance records with a single day high of 54 310 and the total of 117 346 for the three day festival The Penn Relays not only provides young runners a platform to shine but they also give an opportunity for older runners to show that they still have talent The Penn Relays Masters Race offers 4 100 4 400 and 100M dash for men and women who are between the ages of 40 and 70 years old Franklin Field Franklin Field was opened in 1895 specifically for the first Penn Relay Carnival In this same year Franklin Field was the site of the nation s first scoreboard According to the NCAA Franklin Field is the oldest stadium that functions as both a football field and a track and field stadium In the fall of 1903 it became the first permanent college stadium in the country and the first stadium with a horseshoe design The stadium was rebuilt in 1922 to its present day form The lower deck seating was made more stable and the upper deck seating was added to the stadium to allow for more spectators After Franklin Field s renovations it became the first two tiered stadium In 1967 the 10 lane synthetic track was added replacing the old overused track In 1969 the football field became an artificial turf field Franklin Field plays host to University of Pennsylvania football games and the Penn Relay Carnival Prizes The plaque The plaque was first given out at the 1925

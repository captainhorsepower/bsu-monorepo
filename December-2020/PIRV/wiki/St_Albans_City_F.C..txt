rumours at the time of the promotion that St Albans were possibly moving to a larger venue However nothing was confirmed or denied 2006 07 season The Saints first three games in the Conference were a mixed affair with the team winning drawing and losing their first three games respectively After then St Albans had a poor run of games and were hovering around the relegation zone Their hopes being restricted by being a part time team whilst going up against full time opponents However Colin Lippiatt remained positive about his team s chances Having been knocked out in the FA Cup 4th Qualifying Round by Yeading the team s concentration was focused on staying in the Conference St Albans started the second half of the season just one place off the relegation zone In terms of transfers The Saints allowed defender Dave Theobald to return to the Conference North team Kettering Town but they re signed defender Djoumin Sangare on loan from Grays Athletic until the end of the season Lippiatt also signed Chris Watters and Leon Archer from neighbours Boreham Wood for an undisclosed fee on two year contracts In January 2007 director and chief football writer for The Mail on Sunday Ian Ridley left the club amid disagreement over policy Ridley argued that the club needed to bring in older more experienced players citing Steve Claridge to bolster the campaign to stay in the Conference the remainder of the board wanted to maintain a strong reliance of young hungry players St Albans continued throughout the new year with a run of poor results On 9 April 2007 Easter Monday a 1 1 draw with

Southport Tamworth and Altrincham In addition to the Saints returning to the Conference South Colin Lippiatt resigned as manager at the end of the season In a statement he stated that it was right and proper for him to leave He has since rejoined Conference side Woking where he was once manager as a director Back to the Conference South After relegation to the Conference South St Albans appointed inexperienced Ritchie Hanlon as their new manager who had only retired through injury in January He had a huge task to rebuild the squad Nick Roddis had left the club after finding out that he would not be interviewed for the vacant manager position Chris Watters rejoined his old club Boreham Wood for a nominal fee only 5 months after joining the Saints Goalkeeper Paul Bastock was released by mutual consent later joining Rushden Diamonds More players where to leave Clarence Park as Striker Leon Archer joined Braintree Town and Midfielder Tom Davis joined Lewes after both made it clear that they did not want to play for St Albans Dean Cracknell also left the club to join Hemel Hempstead Hanlon however bolstered the squad with numerous new signings Gary Burrell joined from Heybridge Swifts Mark Beard joined from Stevenage Borough as player assistant manager Paul Bruce joined from Dagenham Redbridge So Solid Crew Rapper Former AFC Wimbledon player Junior Harvey was recruited another player from Dagenham Redbridge was brought in Nick Eyre signed to replace Veteran Paul Bastock This was backed up with two youth signings Hector Mackie Reis Noel and finally Hanlon added Hassan Sulaiman Paul Semakula to the ranks Not long into October after a bad string of results Richie Hanlon was sacked as St Albans manager Former Hendon and AFC Wimbledon manager Dave Anderson was given the role and has since taken City to one win at Bromley and a draw He has wasted no time in adjusting the squad and has signed Jon Stevenson and Gary O Connor amongst others Anderson became another managerial casualty after the 4 0 New Year defeat to Cambridge City England U19 scout and former City boss Steve Castle was next put in the position and he declared his ambition to bring former players of the Saints back to Clarence Park This prompted rumours of returns for Matt Hann and Patrick Ada amongst others On 8 January Castle signed Dean Cracknell and Simon Martin who are both former Saints Things began to look up for the team with goalkeeper Paul Bastock who was later voted Player of the Season by fans rejoining from Rushden and Diamonds helping City to long unbeaten run Included in this run of results was the 2 0 victory over top of the league Lewes thanks to Paul Hakim and a stunner from Lee Clarke later voted goal of the season Soon City were on the tail of Weston Super Mare for survival With a stunning 3 2 victory over playoff chasers Eastleigh Town F C secured their safety in the Conference South Eastleigh brought many a fan to Clarence Park with drums and all and they took the lead when former Saint Matt Hann went down in the box and Eastleigh converted the penalty The Eastleigh fans went wild and they maintained the lead and their singing voices until half time In the second half city loanee Bradley Gray equalised with a shot from the edge of the area that squeezed inside the post before Akanni Sunday Wasiu put City ahead moments later By now the City fans were going crazy and the result seemed beyond doubt when Sunday completed his brace Another former Saint Steve Watts scored a great effort but City survive in both the game and the lead 2008 09 season After retaining many of the previous season s squad Steve Castle set promotion as a target for the team after deciding to stay on himself St Albans did not start brilliantly failing to win in the first few games However the Saints recovered to begin a run of 7 wins to see them climb into the playoff positions Paul Hakim scored many goals for City during this time further rekindling his relationship with the fans When the run ended City went on a run of three games without winning dropping to mid table In the FA Trophy the Saints saw off Dartford before meeting local rivals Stevenage Borough in the next round Saints lost 4 1 conceding three goals in the last ten minutes 2009 10 season financial worries In Summer 2009 it was announced that Gibson s building firm William Verry were to go into administration with debts mounting continuously Gibson himself released a statement in regards to the club s future stating that it was safe In the month that followed Gibson released another statement regarding the club s finances Following this statement there were rumours of buy outs by a rival building firm who had taken on a number of William Verry s contracts This apparently was unfounded Another interested party was apparently Watford central defender Darren Ward 2010 12 The summer of 2010 went somewhat smoother for the Saints as the financial worries that had plagued the team in 2009 had thankfully not returned and Steve Castle was able to get on with assembling his squad for the new season albeit with one of the smallest budgets in the league Pre season friendlies were lined up with the likes of Watford and Leyton Orient before the Saints kicked off their Conference South season with a trip to Thurrock in mid August In the week leading up to the game City were boosted by the return of former Saints favourites Ben Martin and Hassan Sulaiman who joined other key players Pete Smith Paul Bastock and Drew Roberts in the new squad City opened their account for the season with a 2 2 draw with the Fleet with goals from Roberts and the newly improved Inih Effiong setting them up with a two goal lead before being pegged back before full time Despite missing the chance to win it was considered a good point away from home against strong opposition With the signing of Adam Martin completed meaning he joined Robbie and Ben on the club s list of Martins the Saints continued their campaign with the visit of Basingstoke Town A closely fought encounter ended 0 0 although the Saints had a good chance to scrape the game when Drew Roberts squared for Inih Effiong only for the big striker to slip in the sodden conditions before firing wide The Saints third match of the season was another home encounter this time with the much changed Braintree Town City s veteran goalkeeper Paul Bastock was in sparkling form to twice deny Braintree from close range as the Saints ground out another goalless draw St Albans best chance of the game fell to winger Joe Richards whose close range header was clawed out by the Irons stopper thus leaving City with three points from three games and extending their Conference South unbeaten run to four games including last season s final day draw with Bath City On 4 February 2011 the F A fined St Albans 7 500 and deducted 10 league points The punishment was handed down to City chairman John Gibson and then vice chairman Alasdair McMillin during a Regulatory Hearing at the Association s offices at Wembley and was in relation to alleged illegal payments to players described by the FA as financial

Castle was released after many weeks of speculation His successor was announced on 18 June to be former Harrow Borough manager David Howell who has recently taken Harrow to the play offs in the Isthmian League Premier Division 2011 2012 Now playing in the Southern League Premier Division for the first time in their history and at their lowest level for 20 years the saints weren t considered one of the favourites for the division although a late surge in late Jan and Feb took the club to the brink of the play offs however only 1 win in the final 5 games meant St Albans finished 8th 2012 2013 David Howell started the season with a much improved budget and St Albans were among the favourites for the division signing players like Barry Hayles despite starting the season well a slump in October and November which also saw early exits in the FA Cup and FA Trophy saw David Howell sacked and youth team coaches James Gray and Graham Golds take over initially as a caretaker management team however the performances improved with some better football and they were given the job full time However several players left over the Christmas period and the owners introduced a controversial decision to up the admission prices mid season St Albans finished 11th 2013 2014 The 2013 2014 season was a major success with pre season signings of the calibre of John Frendo who was the league s top scorer the previous season After an indifferent start that saw St Albans lose 4 games up to the end of September it was the arrival of Rambir Marwa in midfield that saw a change in fortunes St Albans made the FA Cup 1st Round for the 1st time since 2002 losing 8 1 at home to Mansfield Town in front of 3000 supporters and they also made the FA Trophy 2nd Round losing to eventual winners

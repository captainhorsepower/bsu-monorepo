Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba
The Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba French Parti progressiste conservateur du Manitoba is a centre right political party in Manitoba Canada It is currently the governing party in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba after winning a substantial majority in the 2016 election and maintaining a majority in the 2019 election Origins and early years The origins of the party lie at the end of the nineteenth century Party politics were weak in Manitoba for several years after it entered Canadian confederation in 1870 The system of government was essentially one of non partisan democracy though some leading figures such as Marc Amable Girard were identified with the Conservatives at the federal level The government was a balance of ethnic religious and linguistic communities and party affiliation was at best a secondary concern In 1879 Thomas Scott not to be confused with another person of the same name who was executed by Louis Riel s provisional government in 1870 and Joseph Royal attempted to introduce partisan politics into the province Both were Conservatives and both believed that they could lead a provincial Conservative Party Their plans were thwarted by Premier John Norquay who also supported the Conservatives at the federal level but included both Liberals and Conservatives in his governing alliance Norquay himself formed a reluctant alliance with the provincial Conservatives in 1882 in the face of strong opposition from Thomas Greenway s Provincial Rights Party His government was for all intents and purposes Conservative for the remainder of its time in office though Norquay continued to describe it as non partisan Starting in the election of 1883 moreover political parties began to be listed on the provincial election ballot Subsequent development of the party to 1899 When Norquay resigned as Premier in 1887 his successor David H Harrison also became leader of the Conservative parliamentary caucus Norquay was able to reclaim the latter position early in 1888 following an extremely divided meeting of senior Conservative politicians By this time the new Liberal Premier Thomas Greenway had formally introduced party government to the province and no one doubted that Norquay was now the province s Conservative leader The Conservative Party was not yet a legally recognized institution in the province however and began to lose its coherence again after Norquay s death in 1889 Conservative MLAs simply referred to themselves as the opposition for most of the decade that followed Rodmond Roblin was the dominant Conservative MLA between 1890 and 1892 but he does not seem to have been recognized as an official leader After Roblin s defeat in the election of 1892 William Alexander Macdonald became the leader of the opposition In 1893 his election for Brandon City was declared invalid and he lost the subsequent by election Remarkably the election of Macdonald s successor John Andrew Davidson was also voided in 1894 For the remainder of this parliament James Fisher seems to have been the leading figure in the opposition ranks It is not clear if he was formally recognized as leader of the opposition or even as an official member of the Conservative Party Rodmond Roblin was re elected in 1896 and officially became opposition leader in the legislature The next year Hugh John Macdonald son of former Prime Minister John A Macdonald became the party s official leader while Roblin continued to lead the opposition in parliament Taking power 1899 1915 The Conservative Party became an official entity in 1899 and drew up its first election platform in the same year It promised a board of education for the province the creation of agricultural and technical colleges and government ownership of railways Hugh John Macdonald became Premier following in the 1899 election but resigned shortly thereafter to re enter federal politics Rodmond Roblin succeeded Macdonald and ruled the province for fifteen years Roblin s government was progressively oriented negotiated the extension of the railway bought Manitoba s Bell telephone operations in order to establish a government run system introduced corporate taxation and created a public utilities commission while running a budgetary surplus It was less progressive on social issues however and is most frequently remembered today for its opposition to women s suffrage The Tories were brought down in 1915 by a scandal involving the construction of the province s new legislative buildings Roblin was forced to resign as Premier and James Aikins led the party to a disastrous loss later in the year The Manitoba Conservatives received their greatest support from the francophone community in the 1915 election because the party was seen as more supportive than the Liberals of francophone education rights This was a pronounced contrast to the situation in federal politics where most francophone Canadians opposed the war policies of Prime Minister Robert Borden In the political wilderness 1915 1940 Aime Benard was chosen as leader pro tem of the party on August 15 1915 and Albert Prefontaine was chosen as the official parliamentary leader shortly thereafter The party was a minor force in parliament however and was largely sidelined by the radical farmer and labour movements of the late 1910s On November 6 1919 the Conservative Party chose farmer R G Willis to lead the party into its next electoral campaign Willis s selection was a response to the provincial victory of the United Farmers of Ontario the previous month he defeated Major Fawcett Taylor after three other candidates including Prefontaine withdrew their names The vote total was not announced Willis was defeated in the election of 1920 and the Conservatives became the fourth largest group in parliament with only six seats John Thomas Haig subsequently became their parliamentary leader and Fawcett Taylor was chosen as the official party leader in early 1922 The Conservatives gradually regained support in the following twenty years but were unable to defeat the Progressive government of John Bracken In 1932 Bracken s Progressives formed an alliance with the Manitoba Liberal Party to ensure that Taylor would not become the province s Premier Taylor resigned as party leader in 1933 and W Sanford Evans served as parliamentary leader for the next three years In 1936 Errick Willis son of R G was acclaimed as party leader He led the party in another unsuccessful challenge to the Bracken ministry in 1936 In coalition 1940 1950 In 1940 Willis agreed to join Bracken in a wartime coalition government Willis himself was given a prominent cabinet position in the all party ministry which followed Three anti coalition Conservatives were elected to the legislature in 1941 One of these Huntly Ketchen served as leader of the opposition This group did not constitute a rival to the official Conservative Party however In 1946 the party changed its name to the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba to reflect the change in name of the federal Progressive Conservatives Relations between the Tories and Liberal Progressives deteriorated after Douglas Campbell became Premier in 1948 and the Tories voted 215 7 to leave the coalition in 1950 Varying fortunes 1953 1975 The 1953 election was won by the Liberals and Willis was compelled to accept a leadership challenge the following year Duff Roblin grandson of Rodmond Roblin became party leader on the second ballot and rebuilt the party s organization which had been weakened during the coalition period In 1958 Roblin s Tories ran and were elected to a minority government on a progressive platform of increased education grants crop insurance extension of hydro to the north and road construction Remarkably his platform was well to the left of that of Campbell s Liberal Progressives In 1959 Roblin returned to the polls and won a majority which pursued a policy of social investment active government and social reform including reintroducing French to schools and expanding welfare services In 1967 Roblin left provincial politics and was replaced by Walter Weir a member of the party s rural conservative wing Weir led a somewhat more cautious and restrained government and was defeated by the New Democratic Party under Edward Schreyer in 1969 Sidney Spivak a Red Tory like Roblin led the party from 1971 to 1975 but was unable to defeat Schreyer s government The party under Sterling Lyon 1975 1981 Sterling Lyon became leader of the party in 1975 and took it in a more conservative direction anticipating the neoconservatism of Margaret Thatcher Ronald Reagan and Mike Harris The Lyon Tories defeated the NDP in 1977 The Lyon government was to the right of previous Tory administrations and implemented a program of spending cuts and reduced taxes while also promoting mega projects in the energy sector Manitobans were unreceptive to the government s conservatism and turned it out of office in 1981 after only one term bringing the NDP back to power The party under Gary Filmon 1983 1999 Gary Filmon became leader of the Progressive Conservatives in 1983 and formed a minority government in 1988 after defeating the NDP Filmon s Tories remained in power for three terms winning a majority government in 1990 and again in 1995 Filmon s government avoided excessive conservative rhetoric but nonetheless reduced corporate taxes mandated balanced budgets and limited the power of teacher s and nurse s unions It supported the Charlottetown Accord a proposal for amending the Canadian constitution as well as free trade with the United States The party s financial austerity program resulted in a balanced budget in 1995 the first in 20 years The Tories were hurt in the late 1990s by increased unemployment a vote manipulation scandal from the 1995 election see Independent Native Voice and the decline of the Manitoba Liberal Party The latter development allowed the anti Tory vote to coalesce around the NDP Ahead of the 1999 election Filmon announced that his government would undertake a shift further to the right if reelected The voters were not receptive to this and ousted the Tories in favour of the NDP Return to the wilderness 1999 2015 Filmon resigned as leader in 2000 and was replaced by Stuart Murray The party fell to twenty seats in the election of 2003 its worst showing since 1953 On November 5 2005 at a meeting regarding a possible leadership convention in the near future Stuart Murray received only 45 support from party members On November 14 Stuart Murray stepped down as leadership of the party Hugh McFadyen became leader of the party at the leadership convention on April 29 2006 garnering two thirds of the first ballot vote In McFadyen s first campaign as party leader during the 2007 provincial election popular support for PC Party rose two percent over 2003 numbers Although he managed to capture a greater percentage of the provincial vote the Tories lost one seat After failing to make major gains in the 2011 provincial election McFadyen agreed to step down as leader On July 30 2012 former federal MP and Filmon cabinet minister Brian Pallister was acclaimed as leader Pallister as Premier 2016 present By the time the writs were dropped for the 2016 provincial election the Manitoba Tories had been leading in opinion polls for almost four years and were heavily favoured to win As expected Pallister led the party to a decisive victory The Tories won 40 out of 57 seats the largest majority government in the province s history Pallister was re elected to a majority government in 2019 Leaders of the party John Norquay October 1878 December 1887 Premier 1878 1887 David Howard Harrison

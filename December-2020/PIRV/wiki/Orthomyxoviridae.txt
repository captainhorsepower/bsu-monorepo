Orthomyxoviridae
Orthomyxoviridae orth s Greek for straight m xa Greek for mucus is a family of negative sense RNA viruses It includes seven genera Alphainfluenzavirus Betainfluenzavirus Deltainfluenzavirus Gammainfluenzavirus Isavirus Thogotovirus and Quaranjavirus The first four genera contain viruses that cause influenza in birds see also avian influenza and mammals including humans Isaviruses infect salmon the thogotoviruses are arboviruses infecting vertebrates and invertebrates such as ticks and mosquitoes The Quaranjaviruses are also arboviruses infecting vertebrates birds and invertebrates arthropods The four genera of Influenza virus that infect vertebrates which are identified by antigenic differences in their nucleoprotein and matrix protein are as follows Alphainfluenzavirus infects humans other mammals and birds and causes all flu pandemics Betainfluenzavirus infects humans and seals Deltainfluenzavirus infects pigs and cattle Gammainfluenzavirus infects humans pigs and dogs Structure The influenzavirus virion is pleomorphic the viral envelope can occur in spherical and filamentous forms In general the virus s morphology is ellipsoidal with particles 80 to 120 nm in diameter or filamentous with particles 80 to 120 nm in diameter and up to 20 m long There are some 500 distinct spike like surface projections in the envelope each projecting 10 to 14 nm from the surface with varying surface densities The major glycoprotein HA spike is interposed irregularly by clusters of neuraminidase NA spikes with a ratio of HA to NA of about 4 5 to 1 The viral envelope composed of a lipid bilayer membrane in which the glycoprotein spikes are anchored encloses the nucleocapsids nucleoproteins of different size classes with a loop at each end the arrangement within the virion is uncertain The ribonuclear proteins are filamentous and fall in the range of 50 to 130 nm long and 9 to 15 nm in diameter They have a helical symmetry Genome Viruses of the family Orthomyxoviridae contain six to eight segments of linear negative sense single stranded RNA They have a total genome length that is 10 000 14 600 nucleotides nt The influenza A genome for instance has eight pieces of segmented negative sense RNA 13 5 kilobases total The best characterised of the influenzavirus proteins are hemagglutinin and neuraminidase two large glycoproteins found on the outside of the viral particles Neuraminidase is an enzyme involved in the release of progeny virus from infected cells by cleaving sugars that bind the mature viral particles By contrast hemagglutinin is a lectin that mediates binding of the virus to target cells and entry of the viral genome into the target cell The hemagglutinin H and neuraminidase N proteins are targets for antiviral drugs These proteins are also recognised by antibodies i e they are antigens The responses of antibodies to these proteins are used to classify the different serotypes of influenza A viruses hence the H and N in H5N1 The genome sequence has terminal repeated sequences repeated at both ends Terminal repeats at the 5 end 12 13 nucleotides long Nucleotide sequences of 3 terminus identical the same in genera of same family most on RNA segments or on all RNA species Terminal repeats at the 3 end 9 11 nucleotides long Encapsidated nucleic acid is solely genomic Each virion may contain defective interfering copies In Influenza A H1N1 PB1 F2 is produced from an alternative reading frame in PB1 The M and NS genes produce two different genes via alternative splicing Replication cycle Typically influenza is transmitted from infected mammals through the air by coughs or sneezes creating aerosols containing the virus and from infected birds through their droppings Influenza can also be transmitted by saliva nasal secretions feces and blood Infections occur through contact with these bodily fluids or with contaminated surfaces Out of a host flu viruses can remain infectious for about one week at human body temperature over 30 days at 0 C 32 F and indefinitely at very low temperatures such as lakes in northeast Siberia They can be inactivated easily by disinfectants and detergents The viruses bind to a cell through interactions between its hemagglutinin glycoprotein and sialic acid sugars on the surfaces of epithelial cells in the lung and throat Stage 1 in infection figure The cell imports the virus by endocytosis In the acidic endosome part of the haemagglutinin protein fuses the viral envelope with the vacuole s membrane releasing the viral RNA vRNA molecules accessory proteins and RNA dependent RNA polymerase into the cytoplasm Stage 2 These proteins and vRNA form a complex that is transported into the cell nucleus where the RNA dependent RNA polymerase begins transcribing complementary positive sense cRNA Steps 3a and b The cRNA is either exported into the cytoplasm and translated step 4 or remains in the nucleus Newly synthesised viral proteins are either secreted through the Golgi apparatus onto the cell surface in the case of neuraminidase and hemagglutinin step 5b or transported back into the nucleus to bind vRNA and form new viral genome particles step 5a Other viral proteins have multiple actions in the host cell including degrading cellular mRNA and using the released nucleotides for vRNA synthesis and also inhibiting translation of host cell mRNAs Negative sense vRNAs that form the genomes of future viruses RNA dependent RNA transcriptase and other viral proteins are assembled into a virion Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase molecules cluster into a bulge in the cell membrane The vRNA and viral core proteins leave the nucleus and enter this membrane protrusion step 6 The mature virus buds off from the cell in a sphere of host phospholipid membrane acquiring hemagglutinin and neuraminidase with this membrane coat step 7 As before the viruses adhere to the cell through hemagglutinin the mature viruses detach once their neuraminidase has cleaved sialic acid residues from the host cell After the release of new influenza virus the host cell dies Orthomyxoviridae viruses are one of two RNA viruses that replicate in the nucleus the other being retroviridae This is because the machinery of orthomyxo viruses cannot make their own mRNAs They use cellular RNAs as primers for initiating the viral mRNA synthesis in a process known as cap snatching Once in the nucleus the RNA Polymerase Protein PB2 finds a cellular pre mRNA and binds to its 5 capped end Then RNA Polymerase PA cleaves off the cellular mRNA near the 5 end and uses this capped fragment as a primer for transcribing the rest of the viral RNA genome in viral mRNA This is due to the need of mRNA to have a 5 cap in order to be recognized by the cell s ribosome for translation Since RNA proofreading enzymes are absent the RNA dependent RNA transcriptase makes a single nucleotide insertion error roughly every 10 thousand nucleotides which is the approximate length of the influenza vRNA Hence nearly every newly manufactured influenza virus will contain a mutation in its genome The separation of the genome into eight separate segments of vRNA allows mixing reassortment of the genes if more than one variety of influenza virus has infected the same cell superinfection The resulting alteration in the genome segments packaged into viral progeny confers new behavior sometimes the ability to infect new host species or to overcome protective immunity of host populations to its old genome in which case it is called an antigenic shift Classification In a phylogenetic based taxonomy the category RNA virus includes the subcategory negative sense ssRNA virus which includes the order Articulavirales and the family Orthomyxoviridae The genera associated species and serotypes of Orthomyxoviridae are shown in the following table Types There are four genera of influenza virus each containing only a single species or type Influenza A and C infect a variety of species including humans while influenza B almost exclusively infects humans and influenza D infects cattle and pigs Influenza A Influenza A viruses are further classified based on the viral surface proteins hemagglutinin HA or H and neuraminidase NA or N Sixteen H subtypes or serotypes and nine N subtypes of influenza A virus have been identified Further variation exists thus specific influenza strain isolates are identified by a standard nomenclature specifying virus type geographical location where first isolated sequential number of isolation year of isolation and HA and NA subtype Examples of the nomenclature are A Brisbane 59 2007 H1N1 A Moscow 10 99 H3N2 The type A viruses are the most virulent human pathogens among the three influenza types and cause the most severe disease The serotypes that have been confirmed in humans ordered by the number of known human pandemic deaths are H1N1 caused Spanish flu in 1918 and Swine flu in 2009 H2N2 caused Asian Flu H3N2 caused Hong Kong Flu H5N1 avian or bird flu H7N7 has unusual zoonotic potential H1N2 infects pigs and humans H9N2 H7N2 H7N3 H10N7 Influenza B Influenza B virus is almost exclusively a human pathogen and is less common than influenza A The only other animal known to be susceptible to influenza B infection is the seal This type of influenza mutates at a rate 2 3 times lower than type A and consequently is less genetically diverse with only one influenza B serotype As a result of this lack of antigenic diversity a degree of immunity to influenza B is usually acquired at an early age However influenza B mutates enough that lasting immunity is not possible This reduced rate of antigenic change combined with its limited host range inhibiting cross species antigenic shift ensures that pandemics of influenza B do not occur Influenza C The influenza C virus infects humans and pigs and can cause severe illness and local epidemics However influenza C is less common than the other types and usually causes mild disease in children Influenza D This is a genus that was classified in 2016 the members of which were first isolated in 2011 This genus appears to be most closely related to Influenza C from which it diverged several hundred years ago There are at least two extant strains of this genus The main hosts appear to be cattle but the virus has been known to infect pigs as well Viability and disinfection Mammalian influenza viruses tend to be labile but can survive several hours in mucus Avian influenza virus can survive for 100 days in distilled water at room temperature and 200 days at 17 C 63 F The avian virus is inactivated more quickly in manure but can survive for up to 2 weeks in feces on cages Avian influenza viruses can survive indefinitely when frozen Influenza viruses are susceptible to bleach 70 ethanol aldehydes oxidizing agents and quaternary ammonium compounds They are inactivated by heat of 133 F 56 C for minimum of 60 minutes as well as by low pH 2 Vaccination and prophylaxis Vaccines and drugs are available for the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza virus infections Vaccines are composed of either inactivated or live attenuated virions of the H1N1 and H3N2 human influenza A viruses as well as those of influenza B viruses Because the antigenicities of the wild viruses evolve vaccines are reformulated annually by updating the seed strains When the antigenicities of the seed strains and wild viruses do not match vaccines fail to protect the vaccinees In addition even when they do match escape mutants are often generated Drugs available for the treatment of influenza include Amantadine and Rimantadine which inhibit the uncoating of virions by interfering with M2 and Oseltamivir marketed under the brand name Tamiflu Zanamivir and Peramivir which inhibit the release of virions from infected cells by interfering with NA However escape mutants are often generated for the former drug and less frequently for the latter drug See also Dog flu Influenza like illness References Further reading External links

Vijñāna
Vij na Sanskrit or vi a P li is translated as consciousness life force mind or discernment The term vij na is mentioned in many early Upanishads where it has been translated by terms such as understanding knowledge and intelligence In the P li Canon s Sutta Pitaka s first four nik yas vi a is one of three overlapping Pali terms used to refer to the mind the others being manas and citta Each is used in the generic and non technical sense of mind in general but the three are sometimes used in sequence to refer to one s mental processes as a whole Their primary uses are however distinct Buddhism This section considers the Buddhist concept primarily in terms of Early Buddhism s Pali literature as well as in the literature of other Buddhist schools Pali literature Throughout Pali literature vi a can be found as one of a handful of synonyms for the mental force that animates the otherwise inert material body In a number of Pali texts though the term has a more nuanced and context specific or technical meaning In particular in the Pali Canon s Discourse Basket Suttapitaka vi a generally translated as consciousness is discussed in at least three related but different contexts 1 as a derivative of the sense bases yatana part of the experientially exhaustive All sabba 2 as one of the five aggregates khandha of clinging upadana at the root of suffering dukkha and 3 as one of the twelve causes nidana of Dependent Origination paticcasamupp da which provides a template for Buddhist notions of kamma rebirth and release In the Pali Canon s Abhidhamma and in post canonical Pali commentaries consciousness vi a is further analyzed into 89 different states which are categorized in accordance with their kammic results Sense base derivative In Buddhism the six sense bases Pali sa yatana Skt a yatana refer to the five physical sense organs cf receptive field belonging to the eye ear nose tongue body the mind referred to as the sixth sense base and their associated objects visual forms sounds odors flavors touch and mental objects Based on the six sense bases a number of mental factors arise including six types or classes of consciousness vi a k y More specifically according to this analysis the six types of consciousness are eye consciousness that is consciousness based on the eye ear consciousness nose consciousness tongue consciousness body consciousness and mind consciousness In this context for instance when an ear s receptive field the proximal stimulus more commonly known by Buddhists as a sense base or sense organ and sound the distal stimulus or sense object are present the associated ear related consciousness arises The arising of these three elements dh tu e g ear sound and ear consciousness lead to the percept known as contact and in turn causes a pleasant unpleasant or neutral feeling to arise It is from such feeling that craving arises See Fig 1 In a discourse entitled The All Sabba Sutta SN 35 23 the Buddha states that there is no all outside of the six pairs of sense bases that is six internal and six external sense bases The To Be Abandoned Discourse Pahanaya Sutta SN 35 24 further expands the All to include first five aforementioned sextets internal sense bases external sense bases consciousness contact and feeling In the famed Fire Sermon dittapariy ya Sutta SN 35 28 the Buddha declares that the All is aflame with passion aversion delusion and suffering dukkha to obtain release from this suffering one should become disenchanted with the All Hence in this context vi a includes the following characteristics vi a arises as a result of the material sense bases yatana there are six types of consciousness each unique to one of the internal sense organs consciousness vi a is separate and arises from mind mano here consciousness cognizes or is aware of its specific sense base including the mind and mind objects vi a is a prerequisite for the arising of craving ta h hence for the vanquishing of suffering dukkha one should neither identify with nor attach to vi a The aggregates In Buddhism consciousness vi a is one of the five classically defined experiential aggregates Pali khandha Skt skandha As illustrated Fig 2 the four other aggregates are material form rupa feeling or sensation vedana perception sanna and volitional formations or fabrications sankhara In SN 22 79 the Buddha distinguishes consciousness in the following manner And why do you call it consciousness Because it cognizes thus it is called consciousness What does it cognize It cognizes what is sour bitter pungent sweet alkaline non alkaline salty unsalty Because it cognizes it is called consciousness This type of awareness appears to be more refined and introspective than that associated with the aggregate of perception sa which the Buddha describes in the same discourse as follows And why do you call it perception Because it perceives thus it is called perception What does it perceive It perceives blue it perceives yellow it perceives red it perceives white Because it perceives it is called perception Similarly in a 5th century CE commentary the Visuddhimagga there is an extended analogy about a child an adult villager and an expert money changer seeing a heap of coins the child s experience is likened to perception the villager s experience to consciousness and the money changer s experience to true understanding pa Thus in this context consciousness denotes more than the irreducible subjective experience of sense data suggested in the discourses of the All see prior section it additionally entails a depth of awareness reflecting a degree of memory and recognition All of the aggregates are to be seen as empty of self nature that is they arise dependent on causes hetu and conditions paticca In this scheme the cause for the arising of consciousness vi a is the arising of one of the other aggregates physical or mental and the arising of consciousness in turn gives rise to one or more of the mental n ma aggregates In this way the chain of causation identified in the aggregate khandha model overlaps the chain of conditioning in the Dependent Origination paticcasamupp da model Dependent origination Consciousness vi a is the third of the traditionally enumerated Twelve Causes nid na of Dependent Origination Pali pa iccasamupp da Skt prat tyasamutp da Within the context of Dependent Origination different canonical discourses represent different aspects of consciousness The following aspects are traditionally highlighted consciousness is conditioned by mental fabrications sa kh ra consciousness and the mind body n mar pa are interdependent and consciousness acts as a life force by which there is a continuity across rebirths Mental fabrication conditioning and kamma Numerous discourses state From fabrications sa kh ra as a requisite condition comes consciousness vi a In three discourses in the Samyutta Nikaya the Buddha highlights three particular manifestations of sa kh ra as particularly creating a basis for the maintenance of consciousness ramma a vi assa hitiy that could lead to future existence to the perpetuation of bodily and mental processes and to craving and its resultant suffering As stated in the common text below in English and Pali these three manifestations are intending planning and enactments of latent tendencies obsessing Thus for instance in the Intention Discourse Cetan Sutta SN 12 38 the Buddha more fully elaborates Bhikkhus what one intends and what one plans and whatever one has a tendency towards this becomes a basis for the maintenance of consciousness When there is a basis there is a support for the establishing of consciousness When consciousness is established and has come to growth there is the production of future renewed existence When there is the production of future renewed existence future birth aging and death sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair come to be Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering The language of the post canonical Samyutta Nikaya commentary and subcommentary further affirm that this text is discussing the means by which kammic consciousness yield s fruit in one s mental continuum In other words certain intentional or obsessive acts on one s part inherently establish in present consciousness a basis for future consciousness s existence in this way the future existence is conditioned by certain aspects of the initial intention including its wholesome and unwholesome qualities Conversely in the Attached Discourse Upaya Sutta SN 22 53 it states that if passion for the five aggregates forms and mental processes are abandoned then owing to the abandonment of passion the support is cut off and there is no base for consciousness Consciousness thus unestablished not proliferating not performing any function is released Owing to its release it is steady Owing to its steadiness it is contented Owing to its contentment it is not agitated Not agitated he the monk is totally unbound right within He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done There is nothing further for this world Mind body interdependency Numerous discourses state From consciousness vi a as a requisite condition comes name form n mar pa In addition a few discourses state that simultaneously the converse is true Consciousness comes from name form as its requisite condition In the Sheaves of Reeds Discourse Nalakalapiyo Sutta SN 12 67 Ven Sariputta uses this famous analogy to explain the interdependency of consciousness and name form It is as if two sheaves of reeds were to stand leaning against one another In the same way from name form as a requisite condition comes consciousness from consciousness as a requisite condition comes name form If one were to pull away one of those sheaves of reeds the other would fall if one were to pull away the other the first one would fall In the same way from the cessation of name form comes the cessation of consciousness from the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of name form Life force aspect and rebirth As described above in the discussion of mental fabrications conditioning of consciousness past intentional actions establish a kammic seed within consciousness that expresses itself in the future Through consciousness s life force aspect these future expressions are not only within a single lifespan but propel kammic impulses kammavega across samsaric rebirths In the Serene Faith Discourse Sampasadaniya Sutta DN 28 Ven Sariputta references not a singular conscious entity but a stream of consciousness vi a sota that spans multiple lives U nsurpassed is the Blessed Lord s way of teaching Dhamma in regard to the attainment of vision Here some ascetic or Brahmin by means of ardour endeavour application vigilance and due attention reaches such a level of concentration that he comes to know the unbroken stream of human consciousness as established both in this world and in the next The Great Causes Discourse Mahanidana Sutta DN 15 in a dialogue between the Buddha and the Ven Ananda describes consciousness vi a in a way that underlines its life force aspect From consciousness as a requisite condition comes name and form Thus it has been said And this is the way to understand how from consciousness as a requisite condition comes name and form If consciousness were not to descend into the mother s womb would name and form take shape in the womb No lord If after descending into the womb consciousness were to depart would name and form be produced for this world No lord If the consciousness of the young boy or girl were to be cut off would name and form ripen grow and reach maturity No lord Thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for name and form i e consciousness Discourses such as this appear to describe a consciousness that is an animating phenomenon capable of spanning lives thus giving rise to rebirth An Anguttara Nikaya discourse provides a memorable metaphor to describe the interplay of kamma consciousness craving and rebirth Ananda One speaks Lord of becoming becoming How does becoming tak e place Buddha nanda kamma is the field consciousness the seed and craving the moisture for consciousness of beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving to become established in one of the three worlds Thus there is re becoming in the future Abhidhammic analysis The Patthana part of the Theravadin Abhidharma analyzes the different states of consciousness and their functions The Therav da school method is to study every state of consciousness Using this method some states of consciousness are identified as positive some negative and some neutral This analysis is based on the principle of karma the main point in understanding the different consciousnesses Altogether according to the Abhidhamma there are 89 kinds of consciousness Fifty four are of the sense sphere related to the five physical senses as well as craving for sensual pleasure 15 of the fine material sphere related to the meditative absorptions based on material objects 12 of the immaterial sphere related to the immaterial meditative absorptions and eight are supramundane related to the realization of Nibb na More specifically a vi a is a single moment of conceptual consciousness and normal mental activity is considered to consist of a continual succession of vi as Vi a has two components the awareness itself and the object of that awareness which might be a perception a feeling etc Thus in this way these vi as are not considered as ultimate underived phenomena as they are based on mental factors cetasika For example jh nic meditative states are described as based on the five ultimate mental factors of applied thought vitakka sustained thought vicara rapture piti serenity sukha and one pointedness ekaggat Overlapping Pali terms for mind According to Bhikkhu Bodhi the post canonical Pali commentary uses the three terms vi a mano and citta as synonyms for the mind sense base mana ayatana however in the Sutta Pitaka these three terms are generally contextualized differently Vi a refers to awareness through a specific internal sense base that is through the eye ear nose tongue body or mind Thus there are six sense specific types of Vi a It is also the basis for personal continuity within and across lives Manas refers to mental actions kamma as opposed to those actions that are physical or verbal It is also the sixth internal sense base ayatana that is the mind base cognizing mental sensa dhamm as well as sensory information from the physical sense bases Citta includes the formation of thought emotion and volition this is thus the subject of Buddhist mental development bhava the mechanism for release The citta is called luminous in A I 8 10 Across Buddhist schools While most Buddhist schools identify six modes of consciousness one for each sense base some Buddhist schools have identified additional modes Six vij nas As described above in reference to the All sabba the Sutta Pitaka identifies six vij nas related to the six sense bases Eye consciousness Ear consciousness Nose consciousness Tongue consciousness Body consciousness Mind consciousness describe the consciousness of ideas Buddhism describes not five but six perceptions Eight vij nas The Yogacara Cittamatra school consider two more consciousnesses a consciousness called klistamanas which gathers the hindrances the poisons the karmic formations the l yavij na is the consciousness basis of everything and has been translated as store consciousness Every consciousness is based on this one It is the phenomenon which explains the rebirth According to Walpola Rahula the store consciousness of Yogacara thought exists in the early texts as well as the citta Amalavij na The amalavij na immaculate consciousness is considered by some Yog c ra schools as a ninth level of consciousness This pure consciousness is identified with the nature of reality parinispanna or Suchness Alternatively amalavij na may be considered the pure aspect of l yavij na Some Buddhists also suggest hrdaya Heart consciousnesses or an eleven consciousnesses theory or an infinity consciousness Contemporary usages Vi na is used in Thai Buddhism to refer specifically to one s consciousness or life force after it has left the body at the moment of death Thais differentiate between winyaan and jid jai which is the consciousness while it is still connected to a living body Even though the jid jai leaves the body while you dream at night and can also externalize during advanced meditation practice it is still connected to the body Hinduism Sri Ramakrishna defines vij na as He alone who after reaching the Nitya the Absolute can dwell in the L l the Relative and again climb from the L l to the Nitya has ripe knowledge and devotion Sages like Narada cherished love of God after attaining the Knowledge of Brahman This is called vijn na Also What is vijnana It is to know God distinctly by realizing His existence through an intuitive experience and to speak to Him intimately Ayon Maharaj has characterized Sri Ramakrishna s views as manifesting what he called a philosophy of Vij na Ved nta In his book Infinite Paths to Infinite Reality 2018 Maharaj describes six major tenets of Ramakrishna s Vij na Ved nta These include the notion that the vij n returns from the state of nirvikalpa sam dhi and attains the richer world affirming nondual realization that God has become everything Based on ancient texts V S Apte 1890 rev 1957 59 provides the following definition for vij nam Knowledge wisdom intelligence understanding

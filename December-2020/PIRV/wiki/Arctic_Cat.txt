and all terrain vehicles ATV s The company s first name was Polar Manufacturing but was soon changed to Arctic Enterprises The company made their first snowmobile in 1960 and in 1970 started the Boss Cat line In 1968 a 15 000 sqft winter wear factory was opened in Rainy River Ontario employing an additional 60 workers Various boat manufacturers including Silver Line Lund and Spirit Marine were bought to attempt to expand the company However Arctic Cat went bankrupt in 1982 Two years later a new company Arctco was created to continue the production of Arctic Cat snowmobiles The company was successful in keeping the Arctic Cat alive and in 1996 the company changed its name to Arctic Cat Over the years the company has attempted many other product lines including snowblowers generators mini bikes personal watercraft helicopters and two wheel drive vehicles Although the brand s headquarters has relocated several times in recent years Arctic Cat continues the majority of its

Snowmobiles Arctic Cat is known for their M series snowmobile models which were 3rd in Market share behind Ski doo and Polaris in 2003 This Skinny Mini prototype sled had features different from other sleds at that time by utilizing parts that provided more than one role and a track that had less width than other sleds reducing rotating mass Arctic Cat discovered that this design was suitable for mountain riding however the trail model developed an overheating issue as the heat exchanges were found to be insufficient when ridden on ice and in marginal snow conditions Though the majority of sleds experienced no issues this resulted in a class action lawsuit and resulted in an out of court settlement where Arctic Cat bought back 3 200 short track Firecat F 7 s from owners These sleds featured a lay down type engine which placed the carburetors in front of the engine which was centered low in the sled to centralize mass and was believed to allow cooler air inlet temperatures Big changes were made to the lineup for the 2007 model year as a new chassis was introduced which was called a twin spar chassis replacing all previous models while adding a new 4 stroke engine the Z1 Jaguar which featured an 1056cc 4 stroke parallel twin In 2009 the Z1 was turbocharged to produce 177 horsepower 132 kW which was 1 horsepower 0 75 kW more than any other production snowmobile The Crossfire and M series remain on the same M series chassis which is a spin off from the original Firecat Chassis All terrain vehicles Arctic Cat started producing utility all terrain vehicles in 1996

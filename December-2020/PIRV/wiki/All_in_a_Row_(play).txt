All in a Row (play)
All in a Row is a play by Alex Oates about a family with an 11 year old child on the autism spectrum The play explores the experiences of the parents of a nonverbal sometimes violent autistic boy and the emotions that they experience on the night before he is taken to a residential school for children with disabilities The play starred Charlie Brooks Simon Lipkin Michael Fox and Hugh Purves and was produced by Paul Virides Productions at the Southwark Playhouse An early draft of All in a Row was long listed for the Bruntwood Prize for Playwriting and the play was chosen as one of the Bolton Octagon Theatre s Top Five in 2017 It was published by Methuen Drama in 2019 The play has had a polarizing effect on critics and audiences for its use of a puppet to portray an autistic child Development All in a Row was inspired by Oates ten years of experience working with autistic children and adults Oates workshopped the script and puppetry with director Dominic Shaw and Si n Kidd designed the puppet used for the character of Laurence Prior to rehearsal period the team contacted the National Autistic Society for consultation on their portrayal of autism NAS arranged for both autistic and non autistic people to provide advice and minor changes to the script were made as a result of this feedback Despite these changes NAS released a statement that they could not support the play overall due to its portrayal of autism In the development stage the team decided that the initial design for the Laurence puppet was too stylistically dark to sensitively portray the character and a more childlike yet still abstract design should be explored Characters The play s main characters are Laurence an 11 year old boy on the autism spectrum who is unable to speak and is sometimes physically aggressive Laurence is portrayed by a puppet operated by puppeteer Hugh Purves Tamora his mother who feels overwhelmed trying to keep Laurence safe and prevent him from harming others Tamora is played by Charlie Brooks Martin his father Martin is played by Simon Lipkin Gary a worker who helps care for Laurence Gary is played by Michael Fox Plot The play opens with Laurence watching Finding Nemo and begins with an intertwined pair of monologues Tamora is giving a motivational talk at an all girls technology college about her heartbeat transmitting product the Heart to Heart and Martin is describing an incident that occurred in a park in which Laurence attempted to bite a little girl The rest of the play is presented in real time over the course of an evening Somebody has phoned social services and reported that Laurence has bruises As a result there has been a social services enquiry resulting in the decision to move Laurence to a residential school where he can be better cared for A whodunnit or who phoned it theme runs throughout the play as Martin tries to discover who is responsible for the call that resulted in Laurence s departure The support worker Gary acts a conversational go between for Martin and Tamora as they try to bring themselves to read a social story to Laurence detailing how he will be leaving home Martin speaks to Gary about his concerns regarding residential schooling and Tamora confides in Gary her worries and insecurities As the evening progresses Martin and Tamora s relationship degrades and they begin to argue This comes to a head when Martin accuses Gary of making the phone call and Tamora reveals that she was the person who called social services acknowledging her inability to cope and feeling that Laurence would be better cared for by professionals A furious argument triggers a meltdown from Laurence and he bites his mother In the aftermath Martin and Tamora call something of a truce and they sit down as a family to read the social story and watch the end of Finding Nemo Casting and puppetry During casting autistic and disabled performers were encouraged to apply Producers stated that two members of the team that they recruited were autistic but declined to name them in order to respect the requests of those individuals The character of Laurence is played by a life sized custom made puppet operated by a puppeteer rather than a child actor Oates told the Newcastle Chronicle and the BBC that his decision to use puppetry was based on multiple reasons including his admiration for puppetry and the idea that Laurence is a metaphorical puppet of the system which denies him autonomy over his life Just like the puppet used to portray him on stage Laurence is treated like an object that is manipulated by neurotypical people Oates also said he thought that using a puppet as a creative medium was a more sensitive decision than asking an actor to mimic the condition Puppetry director Si n Kidd built the puppet out of natural materials intended to give Laurence a soft quality and chose the colour grey in response to the set design to make Laurence feel like part of his surroundings Themes Love The exploration of love as a concept is a recurring theme of All in a Row This is particularly evident in the character of Tamora named after the Shakespearean mother in Titus Andronicus as she tries to determine how to best keep her son safe Her husband Martin is portrayed as a perpetual child who is hung up on the notion of love In addition the product that Tamora invents was born from her belief that love transforms during parenthood Family The play juxtaposes the movie Finding Nemo with its main story to draw parallels between the characters in each both stories feature parents who are struggling with letting their children go and doing what is best for them It also explores pressures and insecurities that can come with parenting a child with special needs including comparing oneself to other parents and dealing with the guilt of contemplating whether life without their child would be easier Disability Laurence s abilities and needs as an autistic child are a central theme and the play looks at stereotypes and mistakes that people make around disability and the autism spectrum At one point the support worker who is otherwise a likeable character makes an ableist suggestion and is reprimanded immediately suggesting that everyone can get it wrong sometimes The play also explores whether residential schools for children with disabilities or institutionalization are in fact the ideal solution for disabled children concerns about restraining methods etc and the challenge of making an informed decision Reception Use of puppetry Much of the feedback for All in a Row focused on the decision to have Laurence represented by a puppet instead of a living actor While some critics felt that the puppet was an effective representation criticisms of the play started to emerge when a video trailer for the production was released showing the autistic character portrayed by a puppet The controversy spawned the Twitter hashtag puppetgate Special education promoter Anna Kennedy was invited to an open rehearsal which she reviewed stating that she believed employing a puppet in place of a child was appropriate as the role would have been too challenging for a child actor The Reviews Hub also argued that it would have been too hard for a person to play the role of Laurence Writing for The Guardian Miriam Gillinson gave the play four stars calling it lively and truthful and saying that the puppet had a human feel In contrast WhatsOnStage com s Jane Kemp said that the puppet added nothing to the production that a living actor couldn t have provided Writing for The Stage Fergus Morgan called the presence of a puppet a wrong headed decision Saskia Baron of The Arts Desk gave the play a one star rating criticizing the puppet as a redundant clumsy distraction The National Autistic Society which helped the production by providing consultation released a statement on Twitter that While recognising some of the play s strengths we decided we could not support the play overall due to its portrayal of autism particularly the use of a puppet to depict the autistic character alone The artistic director of Southwark Playhouse defended the decision in a statement on Twitter The decision was made in the interest of child protection the themes and some dialogue in the play are of an adult nature also there was a desire to honestly depict the challenges of caring for someone with Laurence s particular behaviour and needs which meant portraying a certain physicality that would be unsafe for a child performer We understand that this has been controversial but within the aims of the project and context of the piece we support the decision by the writer and creative team on the show to use puppetry as a way to depict the character of Laurence On press night for All in a Row February 18 2019 performer Paul Wady founder of the Stealth Aspies Theatre Company organized a protest outside of the theatre to condemn the use of a puppet to portray an autistic child Actress Charlie Brooks who portrays Tamora in the play responded to the controversy saying I understand people s concerns but I do urge people to come and see the play first before they judge Representation of autism Critics had other issues with the play s portrayal of the autism spectrum beyond the use of the puppet Dr Shaun May a senior lecturer in drama and theatre at the University of Kent wrote a thorough review of the play outlining some of these concerns including broader issues such as lack of meaningful engagement with the autistic community and venue accessibility and more specific issues regarding the portrayal of autism in the script including the puppet s stationary expression giving the impression of nobody there Tamora s personality seeming to evoke the refrigerator mother trope and the repeated comparisons of Laurence to animals particularly dogs He draws parallels with the portrayal of the learning disabled character Lennie in John Steinbeck s Of Mice and Men and refers to a critique of this character written by disability studies specialist Sonya Freeman Loftis I am again reminded of Loftis s discussion of Steinbeck s Of Mice and Men where the learning disabled character Lennie is portrayed as animal like and abnormally strong Loftis 2015 Both are features of Laurence s characterisation two out of the three adult characters describe him as being like a dog and a key recurring theme is that this 11 year old is too strong for the adults to manage physically Just as Loftis argues about Lennie these stereotypes simply function to further dehumanise the character so Laurence is sometimes an object and sometimes an animal but never a person British theatre director Stephen Unwin also weighed in on representation in his review criticizing the play for seeming to suggest that all of the family s problems are Laurence s fault It s this sense of self pitying exceptionalism which I think makes All in a Row so misguided and frankly so dangerous The great fight for dignity decency and fundamental rights for people with severe disabilities must be rooted in the deepest sense of our shared humanity Autistic people with high needs are our brothers and sisters our mothers and fathers they are ourselves But if we present them as something uniquely challenging as a bomb that threatens our sanity our family life our capacity for love they will inevitably end up being abused neglected and forgotten Autistic blogger Purple Theo aka Graham Gilligan disagrees with Unwin s opinion that Lawrence is the root cause of his parents problems in his review of the playIt is also important to note that they showed a fractured relationship between Tammy and Martin They rowed often Personally I didn t think that Laurence took the blame for this Author and mother to four autistic children Sarah Ziegel praised the play for its honest depiction It was a brave play To show the severe side of autism It is a play which everyone should see just to get a glimpse of how life is for some families with all its stresses It should be compulsory viewing for everyone who works alongside children with severe autism the social workers the decision makers who don t always see autism at first hand I actually don t know if I would recommend it to my friends who have children with severe autism It is deeply upsetting It may be too hard for them to watch but for them to know their story is being told may be enough I thought of my friends whose children have had to move out of their homes and I cried I cried for them all References External links Official website

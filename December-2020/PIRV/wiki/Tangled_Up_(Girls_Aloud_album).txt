with each member meeting with Higgins to discuss their personal and professional experiences since the release of their third album Chemistry 2005 It was recorded separately between April and July 2007 According to member Cheryl Tangled Up emphasizes a more mature nature than their previous efforts Musically it is a pop album that incorporates elements of dance pop synthpop and various EDM sub genres Lyrically it delves into themes of love relationships and femininity Majority of the numbers consists of synthesizers drum machines electric and acoustic guitars and keyboards whilst it was the group s first experimentation with tools such as autotune and vocoder Upon its release Tangled Up received universal acclaim from music critics who commended the dance oriented sound songwriting and fun production However minor criticism was aimed towards certain inclusions on the record Despite this Tangled Up has been identified by numerous commentators as Girls Aloud and Xenomania s best work Commercially it experienced success in the United Kingdom peaking at number four and was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry BPI for shipments of 300 000 units It performed moderately in Ireland reaching number 25 and was certified gold by the Irish Recorded Music Association IRMA for 7 500 claimed sales In order to promote the album Girls Aloud conducted a series of promotional activities such as television commercial and magazine appearances Three singles were released from the record Sexy No No No Call the Shots and Can t Speak French all achieving critical and commercial success in Europe Furthermore the girl group embarked on their Tangled Up Tour which saw them tour in the UK and the Republic of Ireland Like the album it achieved critical and commercial acclaim and a live DVD was distributed on 27 October 2008 Background and development In April 2007 the group announced that they would release a new studio album in November of that year Initial ideas started in March of that year where each member met with British producer Brian Higgins who had worked with them together on their previous records Each singer visited Higgins at his home in England and discussed their experiences and life endeavours after the release of the third Girls Aloud studio album Chemistry 2005 to his advantage he decided to take inspiration from those discussions and work further on the new record along with his production team Xenomania Member Nicola Roberts reaffirmed that it was important for Higgins to be up to date with where Girls Aloud are at and further commented Our songs have to reflect us so that s why we do it Moreover when asked in an interview with Fascination Records about what fans and critics could expect from the album member Cheryl said they were heading for a more mature direction She also believed that the ideal focus for the record was not to sing about things that we would have when we were 16 Now we re singing about things that you talk about in your early 20s In late March 2007 Higgins and Xenomania started crafting demo songs for the girl group to record which commenced the following month However Higgins provided the demos for member Nadine Coyle to solely record as she had moved to Los Angeles California that year the motive was to allow Coyle to choose what sounds and sections from each song worked for her Subsequently she recorded the tracks in Los Angeles once Higgins mastered the final versions According to member Kimberley Walsh it took Girls Aloud six months to finish recording the album which she found unusual for the group Furthermore she noted that sessions for their previous albums would take a matter of weeks but took longer because the members wanted to experiment more with the production moreover recording had to be halted due to the promotion of the lead single Sexy No No No in the middle of finishing the record Tangled Up was finished in October 2007 and was mastered by Higgins himself with the help of Dick Beetham of 360 Masterings Composition and themes Unlike the group s previous records Tangled Up is a non stop pop album that consistently incorporates elements of electropop dance music Europop and various EDM sub genres Regarding the sound and production Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted that the material was witty diverse and experimental whilst Digital Spy contributor Nick Levine believed it to be their most danceable album to date Tangled Up is the group s first record to not include cover songs and traditional ballads Nadine Coyle said that the tracks from Tangled Up were all in the same vein contrary to their previous releases of which she described the song selection as quite random There are several themes discussed throughout the record including melancholy love relationships sex and femeninity Girls Aloud co wrote two of the twelve tracks on Tangled Up Sexy No No No and Crocodile Tears They also co wrote and recorded a song titled Hoxton Heroes which pokes fun at indie bands The song was deemed too controversial for Tangled Up and therefore omitted from the album however the song was released as a B Side to Can t Speak French Cheryl stated that whilst they never intended to enter the industry as brilliant lyricists they felt comfortable with writing bits and pieces Songs The album opens with Call the Shots an elegant electropop ballad that incorporates elements of 1980s pop and 1990s house and minor Europop sounds Additionally it was described as one of their softer sounding singles in their career and features a solo bridge section by member Nicola Roberts Furthermore Cheryl highlighted it as her favourite track from the album and believed it gives her goosebumps The second track Close to Love was noted by commentators as the kick starter to the album singling out its energetic nature and dance house music as a factor During the verses it features a part rap part singing delivery by member Nadine Coyle The third track of the album Sexy No No No which was released as the record s lead single was described as one of their most daring single releases Incorporating instrumentation such as synthesizers keyboards and vocoder pro tools for Cheryl s vocals at the first part of the recording it is an experimental power pop anthem that emphasizes a rock like sound over top accompanying electronic music Girl Overboard was singled out as one of the better cuts from the album with many critics praising its clubby vibe and 80s inspired house and eurodance music Moreover a Matt O Leary from Virgin Media felt the song was one of the only melodic mentions on Tangled Up Can t Speak French the fifth song on the record is a sultry midtempo number that features electric guitars and synths similar to what was used during the phase of smooth jazz music Likewise Black Jacks is another midtempo recording that boasts 1960s psychedelic music and was compared to the work of Toni Basil and Sugababes Another melodic track to Tangled Up it was selected by some critics as one of the finest moments from both the album and Girls Aloud s career The seventh track Control of the Knife is a reggae and ska influenced tune that incorporates a variety of trumpets drum machines and synthesizers During the song s chorus an uncredited male singer performs the lines Got sweet hassle sweet talking me Got cheap babble cheap talking free through vocoder effects Fling was described by DIY s Stuart McCaighy as a trademark GA track signifying its beefed up dancefloor sound and rap section as examples Similarly Nick Levine at Digital Spy noticed that the track saw Girls Aloud on full vamp mode The ninth song is What You Crying For first described by Cheryl as a garage sound track However critics refutted these comments by defining its sound as drum and bass with influences of pop and two step garage Despite a negative remark by McCaighy many other music editors highlighted the production as forward thinking and believed the members excelled themselves The futuristic I m Falling includes squelchy sounds with a punky guitar which was later compared to Girls Aloud s track Graffiti My Soul by BBC Music s Talia Kraines Damn was one of the only tracks that was not frequently discussed by critics in their reviews for Tangled Up but the pop rock number was criticized for not sonically blending with the rest of the material The album closer Crocodile Tears is an acoustic pop song that focuses more on the members intelligent vocal performances an element to which was never highlighted in their previous work as mentioned by AllMusic s John Lucas Release and packaging Tangled Up was first released in Ireland on 16 November 2007 and throughout Europe on 19 November 2007 It was

covered in rubber while the original photos were placed inside the booklet Additionally the CD came with the lyrics and signed postcards Despite the change which was positively received the artwork

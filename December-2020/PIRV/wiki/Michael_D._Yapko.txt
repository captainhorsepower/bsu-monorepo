Treating depression with clinical hypnosis A proponent of Ericksonian techniques Yapko employs hypnosis and other non drug based therapies in the treatment of depression In his books and articles he presents the view that the depression is a multidimensional disorder with multiple causal factors including biological psychological and social influences As a result he feels that patients respond better to psychotherapy in many cases and that while the use of antidepressants may be called for in some cases they are often overutilized with too little being known about their efficiency or long term effects Repressed memory controversy In the 1990s Yapko generated some controversy among mental health professionals for saying that many therapists use inappropriately suggestive techniques to help patients recall repressed memories of childhood sexual abuse memories that are sometimes suggested by the therapists themselves In a survey he conducted of nearly 1 000 professional therapists he reported that almost 19 percent of those surveyed said they knew of cases where they believed that a patient s trauma had been suggested by their psychotherapist rather than based on a genuine experience Moreover for Yapko the absence of technique specific training of the therapists was a matter of considerable concern less than 45 of those using hypnosis had received formal training in clinical hypnosis Yapko s 1994 book Suggestions of Abuse True and False Memories of Childhood Sexual Trauma directly addressed the issue explaining that some therapists use inappropriate techniques including checklists of symptoms such as depression low self esteem headaches obesity arthritis and acne to diagnose sexual abuse that never actually occurred One critic Lenore Terr a San Francisco psychiatrist and author of Unchained Memories stated in an interview that she felt that Yapko overstates the problem but she admitted that it sometimes happens Two legal scholars noted that Yapko was careful to distinguish between 1 cases in which someone knows all along that he or she was abused 2 cases in which someone independently remembers repressed memories 3 cases in which a therapist facilitates recall of genuinely repressed memories and 4 cases in which a therapist suggests memories of abuse the scholars noted Unfortunately many who share Yapko s concern about improper suggestion fail to heed his caution about reserving judgment until cases are examined on their facts Affiliations and awards Yapko is a member of the American Psychological Association and a clinical member of

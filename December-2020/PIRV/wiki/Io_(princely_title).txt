Io (princely title)
Io Church Slavonic and also I and I Romanian Cyrillic I Greek is the contraction of a title used mainly by the royalty hospodars or voivodes in Moldavia and Wallachia preceding their names and the complete list of titles First used by the Asenid rulers of the Second Bulgarian Empire the particle is the abbreviation of theophoric name Ioan John which comes from the original Hebrew Yohanan meaning God has favored Io appeared in most documents written or engraved as issued by their respective chancelleries since the countries early history but its frequency and relative importance among the princely attributes varied over time Its usage probably dates back to the foundation of Wallachia though it spread to Moldavia only in the 15th century In more informal contexts Romanians occasionally applied the title to benefactors or lieges from outiside the two countries including John Hunyadi and George II R k czi Initially used with Slavonic and Latin versions of documents the word increasingly appeared in Romanian language ones after 1600 With time the Wallachian Io also came to be used by some women of the princely household including Elena N sturel and Doamna Marica The arrival of the Phanariotes as rulers in both countries also ended the practice of avoiding the name John for Princes and created duplications of the original styling as Io John As it entered more general use and its meaning was obscured the title was gradually confounded with the first person pronoun Eu and alternated with the royal we Noi until being finally replaced by it in the 19th century With the rise of modern historiography Io s meaning and origin became entangled in lasting scholarly disputes A final attempt to revive it for Carol as Domnitor of the United Principalities was made by Alexandru Papiu Ilarian in 1866 History Early usage The ultimate origin of Io is with the Biblical Yohanan Hebrew a reference to the divine right and in the baptismal name John an implicit expression of thanks for the child s birth the abbreviation is performed as with other nomina sacra but appears as Ioan in Orthodox Church ectenia The Slavonic very often features a tilde over the second letter which is indicative of a silent n Io is therefore described by scholar Emil V rtosu as both name and title Its connection to the name John and its vocalization as Ioan are explicitly mentioned by Paul of Aleppo who visited Wallachia in the 1650s However he provides no explanation for why this particular name was favored Historian Radu G P un describes it specifically as a theophoric name which served to highlight that princely power derives directly from God and not from an intermediary agency Theologian Ion Croitoru argues that Io placed Wallachian and Moldavian Princes under the patronage of John the Evangelist and that it doubles as a reference to their status as defenders of the Orthodox faith The intermediate origin of Io is the Second Bulgarian Empire 1185 1396 located just south of early medieval territories which became Wallachia and Moldavia As noted by historian A D Xenopol it honors Ivan I Asen in line with titles such as Caesar and Augustus He also makes note of its standardized usage by later Asenids as with the Gospels of Tsar Ivan Alexander 1355 1356 Xenopol sees the Asenid empire as partly Vlach and therefore proto Romanian but rejects the claim that it ever ruled territories in either Moldavia or Wallachia Slavist Ioan Bogdan similarly describes Io as borrowed from the Asenids by diplomatic and paleographic means first in documents as an imitation of Bulgarian documents then in other written monuments The same Bogdan hypothesizes that the title was borrowed in a Moldo Wallachian context as a posthumous homage to the first Asen rulers while Nicolae Iorga sees it as a Vlach title which existed in both lands archivist Damian P Bogdan suggests a third option namely that Io was originally a Medieval Greek title used in the Byzantine Empire a contraction of as used for instance by John II Komnenos and John V Palaiologos This position is also taken by historian Ion Nistor who believes that Ivan Asen left no document to attest his signature During Moldavia and Wallachia s early history the court language was Church Slavonic using Early Cyrillic Early adaptations of Io may date back to Wallachia s creation as an independent polity as noted by Nistor Basarab I was known in neighboring Serbia as Ivanko and therefore John Numismatist Traian Bi a endorsed this interpretation by noting that some period coinage mysteriously minted by a Prince only known as IWAN may be Basarab s own issue The claim according to which Ivanko was the same as Basarab remains disputed by other scholars who believe that it may refer to one of his descendants from the House of Basarab either a poorly attested John Basarab possibly Thocomerius or Basarab s documented son and successor Nicholas Alexander Any explicit use of Io remains unattested until 1364 when it is included on Nicholas Alexander epitaph who as Nistor notes may have been directly inspired by the monogram of John Palaiologos In the 1370s Vladislav I began using Io in his signature though never as an introductory formula on his edicts He also minted coins with inscriptions in either Renaissance Latin or Slavonic Only the latter carry variants of Io and I the Latin ones make no such provision Under Vladislav s brother and successor Radu I coins in Latin began featuring IONS as a translation of and contraction of Iohannes A trove of coins dating back to the rule of Mircea the Elder 1386 1394 1397 1418 uses IWAN for IONS Bi a notes that these were found alongside coins only mentioning IWAN and hypothesizes that they refer to Ivanko Dobrotitsa the last man to ruler over the Dobrujan Despotate The Despotate is generally assumed to have fallen to Mircea s invasion in 1411 with Ivanko being killed in the field of battle Bi a hypothesizes that this invasion ended with an understanding between Mircea and the Dobrujans and that Ivanko may have survived as Mircea s co ruler in the region Mircea was also the first Wallachian to use Io in both his introductory formula and his signature a practice also taken up by his son Michael I Mircea s enemy Vlad I who took the throne in 1396 was the first to use a Slavonic Io on Wallachia s Greater Seal version featuring the Wallachian eagle or raven Upon his return Mircea added Slavonic Io on his Smaller Seal version which unusually featured a lion rampant rather than the bird The seal used only once in 1411 reads I Io Mircea Great Voivode With Latin still in high favor a Slavonic Io was again added to the Greater Seal by Vladislav II in 1451 A version also appears in the Commentaries of Pope Pius II which render Vlad the Impaler s 1462 letter to Mehmed the Conqueror in Latin translation The Slavonic original whereby Vlad places Wallachia under Ottoman vassalage is presumed lost in this surviving version Vlad s name is omitted possibly by mistake and the text is left with Io Voivode Prince of Wallachia Io spread to Moldavia only after it became established in Wallachia Moldavia s first coin series were all Latin and did not use any variant of Io though it was attested by other documentary sources including the full titles of Roman I This historical record is also noted for including references to the Eastern Carpathians and the Black Sea which various historians read as a clue that by 1390 Moldavia had ended its expansion Io also showed up in other texts of that era as with the 1429 Gospels from the time of our honorable and Christ loving Prince Io Alexander Voivoide The same Alexander used the particle more rarely than his contemporaries except on a stole which he donated to the monastery of Staraya Ladoga Its embroidered text shows the Greek version of Io additionally calling Alexander Autokrator of Moldowallachia On various other documents Io alternated with a Slavonic form of the royal we As noted by historian tefan S Gorovei Moldavia s Stephen the Great reigned 1457 1504 introduced himself using both or I and The former is always present on stone carved dedications made by Stephen and on his version of the Greater Moldavian Seal but much less so on the Smaller Seal It also appears in the unusual reference to Stephen as Tsar of Moldowallachia which appears on his illuminated Gospel at Humor Monastery 1473 Io on its own was present on Stephen s church bell at Bistri a Monastery some reports suggest a similar Io inscribed bell once existed at Neam On only three occasions the two words were merged into or I one of these is a 1499 treaty which also carries the Latin translation Nos Johannes Stephanus wayvoda According to Gorovei it is also technically possible that Stephen s Romanian name was vocalized by his boyars as Ioan tefan voievod since the corresponding Slavonic formula appears in one document not issued by Stephen s own chancellery A standalone was also used by Stephen s son and one time co ruler Alexandru Sandrin and appears as such on his princely villa in Bac u It makes its first appearance on coins under Bogdan the Blind who was Stephen s other son and his immediate successor The title could also appear in third person references as with church inscriptions and various documents The 1507 Missal put out by Hieromonk Makarije which is regarded as the first printed work in the history of Romania features dedications to three Wallachian Princes all of them introduced as Io Vlad the Impaler Radu the Great and Mihnea the Evil Another early example also in Wallachia is Neagoe Basarab s reference to himself and his alleged father Basarab epelu named as Io Basarab cel T n r This usage spread to his son and co ruler Teodosie who was otherwise not allowed to use a full regnal title Neagoe would himself be referred to as Io Basarab in a 1633 document by his descendant Matei Basarab which unwittingly clarifies that Neagoe was not epelu s son In the 1530s Io also appeared in ironic usage in reference to Vlad Vintil de la Slatina who was known to his subjects as Io Braga voievod referring to his penchant for drinking braga Vlad Vintil s reign is also noted for the attestation of Io in Modern Greek This appears in a travel account by Antonios Karamalikis an envoy of the Ecumenical Patriarchate which honors Lord Vindyla Ios the latter word is a probable contraction of and as such an additional proof that Io was of Byzantine Bulgarian origins While Io entered regular use and was possibly a name implicitly used by all monarchs in Wallachia and Moldavia derivatives of John only rarely made an appearance as an actual name This means that the combination Io John was not present in early Romanian history One exception was an unofficial reference to John Hunyadi Regent Governor of the neighboring Kingdom of Hungary in the 1450s One of his Romanian subjects the scribe Simeon of H lmagiu called him Io Iancu voievod Only three reigning Princes all of them Moldavian took or kept derivatives of John as their primary names before the 17th century Jacob John Heraclides a foreign born usurper and John the Terrible who was likely an illegitimate child or an impostor Both of them dropped the Io in front of their given name A third Iancu Sasul identified in some sources as Prince Iovan or Ioannis Iancula reigned in 1579 1582 without having any attested blood links to his predecessors He did use the variant Io Iancul probably because Iancu had not been fully identified as a derivative of John An illegitimate pretender known as Iohannes Iancula was last attested living in exile in V sterg tland in 1601 Gorovei proposes the existence of a naming taboo for Ioan as a baptismal name rather than as a title I came to the conclusion that princes avoided giving their sons if born in the purple the name of Ion Ioan Later stages The usage of Io declined under Stephen the Great s other successors down to Peter the Lame reigned 1574 1574 These legitimate Stephanids only used it on their seals The titles of Io and Tsar appear together in chronicler Macarie s reference to Prince Alexandru L pu neanu penned in 1556 According to scholar Dimitrie Nastase this is a direct borrowing from the Humor manuscript However as Nistor notes by the time when boyar Ieremia Movil took the Moldavian throne 1595 1600 1600 1606 Io had declined into a mere diplomatic formula and was no longer read as the attribute of legitimacy and sovereignty The 17th century witnessed a progressive adoption of Romanian as a court vernacular using the localized Cyrillic alphabet Early adaptations of Io in this new cultural context appear in the titles of Michael the Brave who briefly accomplished his project to unite under one rule Wallachia Moldavia and the Principality of Transylvania In one document of May 1600 he declared himself Io Mihail sic Voivode by the Grace of God Prince of Wallachia and of Transylvania and of Moldavia In letters he addressed to his nominal liege Emperor Rudolf he maintains the titles Io and Voivode also preserved in German language copies but omits the other claims and styles himself humble servant of Your Highness His feats of arms were locally celebrated in Muscel County on Wallachia s border with Transylvania with various local figures erecting wayside crosses that refer to their service under Michael The text is in Slavonic rather than Romanian and his name appears with a Slavonic iota on Io as and similar variants After Michael another attempt to connect Io with rule over several countries was made by Vasile Lupu of Moldavia In 1639 he used a seal which reunited the Wallachian and Moldavian arms calling himself Io Vasilie Voievod by the Grace of God Prince of the Moldavian and Wallachian Lands Lupu s attempts at invading Wallachia inaugurated a period of unrest in the latter country leading up to the uprisings led by Seimeni mercenaries In 1655 these groups installed Hrizea of Bogd nei on the throne in Bucharest causing the distressed boyars to demand support from Transylvania Their letter of supplication uniquely addressed Transylvanian Prince George II R k czi with the Voivodal Io also adapting his name into Racol ea Mihnea III who emerged as Prince in 1658 during the latter stages of this conflict used New Latin on his shillings introducing him as IO MICHAEL RAD D CVL TR PR New Latin variants continued to be featured on coins as with 1660s Moldavian shillings issued by Eustratie Dabija or IOHAN ISTRATDORVV some also had the all Latin rendition of as IO At around the same time Wallachia s Antonie Vod was using in his Slavonic title and I in his multilingual autographed signature Io was also found in during the reign of Constantin Cantemir 1685 1693 who stood out among Moldavian princes for being illiterate In this version the signature was a woodblock stamp Slavonic versions were sometimes resumed and extended with the Slavonic Io increasingly appearing with female members of the princely families Possibly the earliest such examples dated 1597 1600 are associated with Doamna Stanca wife of Michael the Brave and mother of Nicolae P tra cu Later examples include donations made by Elena N sturel in 1645 1652 She signs her name as Io Princess Elina of Wallachia In the frescoes of Horezu Monastery completed under Wallachia s Constantin Br ncoveanu Io is used to describe not just the reigning Prince but also his wife Doamna Marica his mother Stanca and his late father Papa Br ncoveanu who never rose above regular boyardom The latest appearance of the title alongside a princess is with Doamna Marica who was also a niece of Antonie Vod is featured on her Slavonic seal of 1689 which she continued to use in 1717 that is after Prince Constantin had been executed Br ncoveanu s downfall inaugurated Phanariote rules with Princes who spoke Modern Greek and in some cases Romanian as their native language One of the first Phanariotes John I Mavrocordatos apparently honored some aspects of tradition According to Bi a this prince did not use Io in front of his title although a and a appear on his 1717 deed to Plumbuita Monastery In this new cultural context Io usually rendered as preceded statements or signatures in both Romanian and Slavonic and became confounded with the Romanian first person singular Eu which can also be rendered as Io In 1882 writer Alexandru Macedonski compared the Hurezu murals with the self styling used by commoners as in Eu Gheorgh e al Petri I Gheorghe son of Petru On such bases Macedonski denied that Io was ever a derivative of John Historian Petre N sturel argues instead that there was a corruption whereby Io came to be vocalized as a Romanian pronoun and that this may explain why it was used by princesses N sturel points to this transition by invoking a 1631 signature by Lupul Coci the future Vasile Lupu in plain Romanian but with Greek characters I Lupul the Great Vornic Nicholas Mavrocordatos a Phanariote intellectual who held the throne of both countries at various intervals also used Latin in which he was known as Iohannes Nicolaus Alexandri Mavrocordato de Skarlati 1722 and Io Nicolai Maurocordati de Scarleti 1728 Romanian language documents issued by this Prince as well as by his competitor Mihai Racovi have Slavonic introductions which include to his Wallachian apologist Radu Popescu Nicholas is known as Io Nicolae Alexandru voevod Constantine Mavrocordatos used both Io Costandin Nicolae in an all Romanian text and Noi Costandin Nicolae in a part Slavonic one All Romanian titles were normalized under various other Phanariotes as with Grigore II Ghica Io Grigoriu Ghica and Alexander Mourouzis Io Alexandrul Costandin Muruz Some noted variations were made by other Phanariotes During his first reign in Wallachia Alexander Ypsilantis modified the Wallachian arms to include his abbreviated title in Greek letters Io appeared as I and twice as the introductory particle and as a rendition of Ypsilantis middle name In 1806 Moldavia s Scarlat Callimachi adopted the Romanian I as his introductory particle As read by historian Sorin Iftimi this should mean Io anume Io that is or I namely rather than the name Ioan The Phanariote era witnessed reigns by hospodars who were actually named John and for whom the Io particle could prove redundant The first such case is with John II Mavrocordatos who called himself Io Ioan in the 1740s at a time when as historian Petre P Panaitescu writes the memory of Io s origin had faded in Moldavia Another early case was an anonymous manuscript in 1780s Moldavia which retrospectively refers to a Io Ioan Grigore voievod Wallachia s John Caradja reigned 1812 1818 was known in his Romanian and Slavonic title as Io Ioan Gheorghe Caragea In the 1820s Ioan Sturdza whose name also translates to John did not duplicate it with an introductory particle on various objects produced during his reign a duplication can still be found on his 1825 frontispiece to Dimitrie Cantemir s Descriptio Moldavi which scholar C t lina Opaschi reads as Ioanu Ioanu Sandul Sturza Similarly a handwritten Gospel by Hieromonk Ierinarh describes the Prince as Io Ioann Sandu Sturza I as used by reigning hospodars was gradually replaced in the 18th and 19th centuries by Noi or oi a localized version of the royal we A 1783 writ by Alexander Mavrocordatos regulating the governance of Moldavian Jews uses both titles Noi in its introduction and Io in the princely signature A variant with the exact spelling Noi appears on the Moldavian Seal used in 1849 by Grigore Alexandru Ghica Alexandru Ioan Cuza elected in 1859 as the first Domnitor to rule over both countries the United Principalities used a transitional mixture of Latin and Cyrillic letters oi Alecsandru Joan 1 on his Moldavian Seal At that stage some lexicographers viewed Io exclusively as a variant of eu the pronoun appears as Io in an 1851 dictionary put out in Moldavia by Teodor Stamati The title Io was also included on replicas of period objects These include the churchbell at Trei Ierarhi which was cast in 1832 as a copy and referred to ktitor Vasile Lupu as Io Vasilie voievod During the 1860s and 70s a period which resulted in the consolidation of union as the Kingdom of Romania the forgotten origins of Io became the object of scrutiny by historical linguists this began in 1863 with an overview by Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu Cuza was deposed by a monstrous coalition in early 1866 and Carol of Hohenzollern eventually took his place as Domnitor In April of that year Alexandru Papiu Ilarian emphasizing the need to Romanianize this foreign arrival proposed in Parliament that he be titled as Ioan Carol In arguing for this Papiu noted that Ioan was not a pronoun and highlighted its origins with the Asenids whom he called Romanian kings over the Danube While the proposal failed to garner support the issue of etymology continued to attract attention In 1934 Sextil Pu cariu s general dictionary listed Eu Io as a popular etymology The subtopic endures

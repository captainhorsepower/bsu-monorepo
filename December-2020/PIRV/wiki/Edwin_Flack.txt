when his family migrated to Australia to live in Berwick Victoria Soon after leaving the Melbourne Church of England Grammar School in 1892 where he studied Greek history Flack joined his father s accountancy firm Davey Flack Co From 1892 to 1894 Flack was active in middle and long distance running in amateur athletics in the then colony of Victoria competing with the Melburnian Hare Hounds athletics club In October 1892 he placed third in the inaugural Victorian 10 mile cross country championship held at Oakleigh Park Racecourse in a time of 1 02 42 0 On 9 to 11 November 1893 an

the end to win by more than five metres in a time of 4 33 2 On the fourth day of the Games Flack earned his second first place medal winning the 800 metres in 2 min 11 9 sec It may be noted that even by the standards of the time the times required to win the 800 m and 1 500 m at the first Olympics were slow Although there was no official world record in that era by way of comparison the local 880

Semen
Semen also known as seminal fluid is an organic fluid created to contain spermatozoa It is secreted by the gonads sexual glands and other sexual organs of male or hermaphroditic animals and can fertilize the female ovum In humans seminal fluid contains several components besides spermatozoa proteolytic and other enzymes as well as fructose are elements of seminal fluid which promote the survival of spermatozoa and provide a medium through which they can move or swim Semen is produced and originates from the seminal vesicle which is located in the pelvis The process that results in the discharge of semen is called ejaculation Semen is also a form of genetic material In animals semen has been collected for cryoconservation Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources is a practice that calls for the collection of genetic material in efforts for conservation of a particular breed Physiology Fertilization Depending on the species spermatozoa can fertilize ova externally or internally In external fertilization the spermatozoa fertilize the ova directly outside of the female s sexual organs Female fish for example spawn ova into their aquatic environment where they are fertilized by the semen of the male fish During internal fertilization however fertilization occurs inside the female s sexual organs Internal fertilization takes place after insemination of a female by a male through copulation In most vertebrates including amphibians reptiles birds and monotreme mammals copulation is achieved through the physical mating of the cloaca of the male and female In marsupial and placental mammals copulation occurs through the vagina Human semen Composition During the process of ejaculation sperm passes through the ejaculatory ducts and mixes with fluids from the seminal vesicles the prostate and the bulbourethral glands to form the semen The seminal vesicles produce a yellowish viscous fluid rich in fructose and other substances that makes up about 70 of human semen The prostatic secretion influenced by dihydrotestosterone is a whitish sometimes clear thin fluid containing proteolytic enzymes citric acid acid phosphatase and lipids The bulbourethral glands secrete a clear secretion into the lumen of the urethra to lubricate it Sertoli cells which nurture and support developing spermatocytes secrete a fluid into seminiferous tubules that helps transport sperm to the genital ducts The ductuli efferentes possess cuboidal cells with microvilli and lysosomal granules that modify the ductal fluid by reabsorbing some fluid Once the semen enters the ductus epididymis the principal cells which contain pinocytotic vessels indicating fluid reabsorption secrete glycerophosphocholine which most likely inhibits premature capacitation The accessory genital ducts the seminal vesicle prostate glands and the bulbourethral glands produce most of the seminal fluid Seminal plasma of humans contains a complex range of organic and inorganic constituents The seminal plasma provides a nutritive and protective medium for the spermatozoa during their journey through the female reproductive tract The normal environment of the vagina is a hostile one c f sexual conflict for sperm cells as it is very acidic from the native microflora producing lactic acid viscous and patrolled by immune cells The components in the seminal plasma attempt to compensate for this hostile environment Basic amines such as putrescine spermine spermidine and cadaverine are responsible for the smell and flavor of semen These alkaline bases counteract and buffer the acidic environment of the vaginal canal and protect DNA inside the sperm from acidic denaturation The components and contributions of semen are as follows A 1992 World Health Organization report described normal human semen as having a volume of 2 mL or greater pH of 7 2 to 8 0 sperm concentration of 20 106 spermatozoa mL or more sperm count of 40 106 spermatozoa per ejaculate or more and motility of 50 or more with forward progression categories a and b of 25 or more with rapid progression category a within 60 minutes of ejaculation A 2005 review of the literature found that the average reported physical and chemical properties of human semen were as follows Appearance and consistency Semen is typically translucent with white grey or even yellowish tint Blood in the semen can cause a pink or reddish colour known as hematospermia and may indicate a medical problem which should be evaluated by a doctor if the symptom persists After ejaculation the latter part of the ejaculated semen coagulates immediately forming globules while the earlier part of the ejaculate typically does not After a period typically ranging from 15 30 minutes prostate specific antigen present in the semen causes the decoagulation of the seminal coagulum It is postulated that the initial clotting helps keep the semen in the vagina while liquefaction frees the sperm to make their journey to the ova A 2005 review found that the average reported viscosity of human semen in the literature was 3 7 cP Quality Semen quality is a measure of the ability of semen to accomplish fertilization Thus it is a measure of fertility in a man It is the sperm in the semen that is the fertile component and therefore semen quality involves both sperm quantity and sperm quality Quantity The volume of semen ejaculate varies but is generally about 1 teaspoonful or less A review of 30 studies concluded that the average was around 3 4 milliliters mL with some studies finding amounts as high as 5 0 mL or as low as 2 3 mL In a study with Swedish and Danish men a prolonged interval between ejaculations caused an increase of the sperm count in the semen but not an increase of its amount Increasing semen volume Some dietary supplements have been marketed with claims to increase seminal volume Like other supplements including so called herbal viagra these are not approved or regulated by the Food and Drug Administration as licensed medications in the US would be and none of the claims have been scientifically verified Similar claims are made about traditional aphrodisiac foods with an equal lack of verification Storage Semen can be stored in diluents such as the Illini Variable Temperature IVT diluent which have been reported to be able to preserve high fertility of semen for over seven days The IVT diluent is composed of several salts sugars and antibacterial agents and gassed with CO2 Semen cryopreservation can be used for far longer storage durations For human sperm the longest reported successful storage with this method is 21 years Health Disease transmission Semen can transmit many sexually transmitted diseases and pathogens including viruses like HIV and Ebola Swallowing semen carries no additional risk other than those inherent in fellatio This includes transmission risk for sexually transmitted diseases such as human papillomavirus HPV or herpes especially for people with bleeding gums gingivitis or open sores Viruses in semen survive for a long time once outside the body Blood in semen hematospermia The presence of blood in semen or hematospermia may be undetectable it can only be seen microscopically or visible in the fluid Its cause could be the result of inflammation infection blockage or injury of the male reproductive tract or a problem within the urethra testicles epididymis or prostate It usually clears up without treatment or with antibiotics but if persistent further semen analysis and other urogenital system tests might be needed to find out the cause Semen allergy In rare circumstances humans can develop an allergy to semen called human seminal plasma sensitivity It appears as a typical localized or systemic allergic response upon contact with seminal fluid There is no one protein in semen responsible for the reaction Symptoms can appear after first intercourse or after subsequent intercourse A semen allergy can be distinguished from a latex allergy by determining if the symptoms disappear with use of a condom Desensitization treatments are often very successful Benefits to females Females may benefit from absorbing seminal fluid Such benefits include male insects transferring nutrients to females via their ejaculate in both humans and bovines the fluid has antiviral and antibacterial properties and useful bacteria such as Lactobacillus have been detected in fluid transferred from birds and mammals Society and culture Qigong Qigong and Chinese medicine place huge emphasis on a form of energy called pinyin j ng also a morpheme denoting essence or spirit which one attempts to develop and accumulate Jing is sexual energy and is considered to dissipate with ejaculation so masturbation is considered energy suicide amongst those who practice this art According to Qigong theory energy from many pathways meridians becomes diverted and transfers itself to the sexual organs during sexual excitement The ensuing orgasm and ejaculation will then finally expel the energy from the system completely The Chinese proverb pinyin y d j ng sh d xu literally a drop of semen is equal to ten drops of blood illustrates this point The scientific term for semen in Chinese is pinyin j ng y literally fluid of essence jing and the term for sperm is pinyin j ng z literally basic element of essence jing two modern terms with classical referents Indian philosophy In the Indian system of medicine called Ayurveda semen is said to be made from 40 drops of blood It is considered as the end of the food digestion cycle One of the key aspects of Hindu religion is abstinence called Brahmacharya It can be lifelong or during a specific period or on specific days Brahmacharya attaches a lot of importance to semen retention Many yogic texts also indicate the importance of semen retention and there are specific asanas and Bandhas for it like Mula Bandana and Aswini Mudra Greek philosophy In Ancient Greece Aristotle remarked on the importance of semen For Aristotle semen is the residue derived from nourishment that is of blood that has been highly concocted to the optimum temperature and substance This can only be emitted by the male as only the male by nature of his very being has the requisite heat to concoct blood into semen According to Aristotle there is a direct connection between food and semen Sperms are the excretion of our food or to put it more clearly as the most perfect component of our food The connection between food and physical growth on the one hand and semen on the other allows Aristotle to warn against engag ing in sexual activity at too early an age since this will affect the growth of their bodies Nourishment that would otherwise make the body grow is diverted to the production of semen Aristotle is saying that at this stage the body is still growing it is best for sexual activity to begin when its growth is no longer abundant for when the body is more or less at full height the transformation of nourishment into semen does not drain the body of needed material Additionally Aristotle tells us that the region round the eyes was the region of the head most fruitful of seed most seedy pointing to generally recognised effects upon the eyes of sexual indulgence and to practices which imply that seed comes from liquid in the region of the eyes This may be explained by the belief of the Pythagoreans that semen is a drop of the brain Greek Stoic philosophy conceived of the Logos spermatikos seminal word as the principle of active reason that fecundated passive matter The Jewish philosopher Philo similarly spoke in sexual terms of the Logos as the masculine principle of reason that sowed seeds of virtue in the feminine soul The Christian Platonist Clement of Alexandria likened the Logos to physical blood as the substance of the soul and noted that some held that the animal semen is substantially foam of its blood Clement reflected an early Christian view that the seed ought not be wasted nor scattered thoughtlessly nor sown in a way it cannot grow Women were believed to have their own version which was stored in the womb and released during climax Retention was believed to cause female hysteria In ancient Greek religion as a whole semen is considered a form of miasma and ritual purification was to be practised after its discharge Sacred semen In some pre industrial societies semen and other body fluids were revered because they were believed to be magical Blood is an example of such a fluid but semen was also widely believed to be of supernatural origin and effect and was as a result considered holy or sacred The ancient Sumerians believed that semen was a divine substance endowed on humanity by Enki the god of water The semen of a god was believed to have magical generative powers In Sumerian mythology when Enki s seed was planted in the ground it caused the spontaneous growth of eight previously nonexistent plants Enki was believed to have created the Tigris and Euphrates rivers by masturbating and ejaculating into their empty riverbeds The Sumerians believed that rain was the semen of the sky god An which fell from the heavens to inseminate his consort the earth goddess Ki causing her to give birth to all the plants of the earth Dew was once thought to be a sort of rain that fertilized the earth and in time became a metaphor for semen The Bible employs the term dew in this sense in such verses as Song of Solomon 5 2 and Psalm 110 3 declaring in the latter verse for example that the people should follow only a king who was virile enough to be full of the dew of youth The orchid s twin bulbs were thought to resemble the testicles which is the etymology of the disease orchiditis There was an ancient Roman belief that the flower sprang from the spilled semen of copulating satyrs In a number of mythologies around the world semen is often considered analogous to breast milk In the traditions of Bali it is considered to be the returning or refunding of the milk of the mother in an alimentary metaphor The wife feeds her husband who returns to her his semen the milk of human kindness as it were Semen in espionage When the British Secret Intelligence Service discovered that semen made a good invisible ink Sir George Mansfield Smith Cumming noted of his agents that Every man is his own stylo Ingestion Spiritual practices The Borborites also known as the Phibionites were an early Christian Gnostic sect during the late fourth century AD whose alleged practices involving sacred semen are described by the early Christian heretic hunter Epiphanius of Salamis in his Panarion Epiphanius claims that the Borborites had a sacred text called the Greater Questions of Mary which contained an episode in which during a post resurrection appearance Jesus took Mary Magdalene to the top of a mountain where he pulled a woman out of his side and engaged in sexual intercourse with her Then upon ejaculating Jesus drank his own semen and told Mary Thus we must do that we may live Upon hearing this Mary instantly fainted to which Jesus responded by helping her up and telling her O thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt This story was supposedly the basis for the Borborite Eucharist ritual in which they allegedly engaged in orgies and drank semen and menstrual blood as the body and blood of Christ respectively Bart D Ehrman a scholar of early Christianity casts doubt on the accuracy of Epiphanius s summary commenting that the details of Epiphanius s description sound very much like what you can find in the ancient rumor mill about secret societies in the ancient world In some cultures semen is considered to have special properties associated with masculinity Several tribes of Papua New Guinea including the Sambia and the Etoro believe that semen promotes sexual maturation among the younger men of their tribe To them semen possesses the manly nature of the tribal elders and in order to pass down their authority and powers younger men of their next generation must fellate their elders and ingest their semen Prepubescent and postpubescent males are required to engage in this practice This act may also be associated with the culturally active homosexuality throughout these and other tribes Semen ingestion has had central importance in some cultures around the world In Baruya culture there is a secret ritual in which boys give fellatio to young males and drink their semen to re engender themselves before marriage Sexual practices There are several sexual practices involving the ingestion of semen The most common of them is simply ingesting it during fellatio They can be done with one or more partners like snowballing felching and creampie eating or with multiple partners like the practices of bukkake and gokkun which originate from Japan Euphemisms A huge variety of euphemisms and dysphemisms have been invented to describe semen For a complete list of terms see sexual slang Slang terms for semen include cum jizz spunk primarily British English spooge and or splooge load nut and less commonly love juice The term cum sometimes also refers to an orgasm while load is derived from the phrase blowing a load referring to an ejaculation See also References External links Grizard G Sion B Bauchart D Boucher D 31 March

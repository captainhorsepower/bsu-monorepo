ever heard This performance inspired Radcliff to form his own band a trio he modeled after Sam s band Radcliff was so inspired by Magic Sam that he soon boarded a bus to Chicago venturing to meet his newfound guitar idol Radcliff arrived in Chicago only to learn Magic Sam had suffered a major heart attack and was in Cook County Hospital Radcliff sat by his bedside until Sam woke up He explained

visited Sam a number of times staying with Sam s family in Chicago One of the most important messages that Sam gave to Radcliff was to listen to all kinds of music country jazz pop classics etc and to continue to be broadminded about the music he listened to because developing your own style was important along with continuing to grow as a musician Sam died in December 1969 at age 32 from a heart attack Radcliff and Dick Waterman attended Sam s funeral together By this time Radcliff s style was infused with Magic Sam s unique sound However the breadth of Radcliff s music drew no boundaries his own stylistic voice emerged helping his career blossom Writer Dave Hussong Vintage Guitar Magazine 1990 touches on Radcliff s expansive musical range as a vocalist instrumentalist and live performer Unencumbered by style restrictions Radcliff brings a sense of intensity and conviction both instrumentally and vocally the latter being an area where many 90 s interpreters fall face down that puts his and this live performance into a very special league of its own In the early 1970s he began performing with his own band at clubs in the Washington D C area with a few key residencies He performed a few nights each week at Cousin Nicks and Sundays and Monday s at Top o Foolery Jazz Club He also frequently performed at Mr Henry s and The Childe Harold Radcliff recorded his first 45 RPM single in

Thunderbird Davis In 1990 Radcliff received a New York Music Award from K Rock radio station for Best Blues Artist That year he also received a five star review from the October issue of Downbeat Magazine for Dresses Too Short From Downbeat Magazine The firebrand s Fender shudders diters and fulminates in a rough deep seated kind of ecstasy too seldom encountered in this age of superficial smoke and verbiage blues guitar Fitting the templates of order and creative intelligence over his crowded bursts of simultaneous leads bass lines and chords the Washington D C native indulges his passion for Buddy Guy and Magic Sam without aping the greats Moreover Radcliff works up a true sweat inspiriting verse behind a stealthily incisive stirring voice that s roughly a cross between Magic Sam s and Jimmy Johnson s Guitar Player s April 1990 issue does an extensive interview of Radcliff praising his style and Dresses Too Short on many levels The Black Top album runs an A to Z gamut of blues styles before closing with Kool And The Gang an early single from the group by the same name with Radcliff s guitar impersonating the entire horn section choreography and all Downbeat Magazine from October 1990 also gave a stellar review of Dresses Too Short By dint of his powers he elevates good songs to the point where the entire program screams out for repeated plays Let s just say Dresses Too Short provides the jolt of a bungee jump off the 59th St Bridge His Live at the Rynborn record showcases his brilliance as a live performer Like a chameleon Radcliff s selections on this record span musical time and genres It was recorded at the now defunct Rynborn club in New Hampshire which helped spawn his following in that area Radcliff continues to perform in New Hampshire at Nelson s Candy Store yearly and sells out every time Steve Hoffman DJ from The Blues Experience on WDCU FM from Washington D C had some choice words about Radcliff s playing on the Live at the Rynborn While many guitarists get into a call and response pattern with the band or the singer Bobby is his own one man call and response machine He juxtaposes guitar rhythm and lead parts so abruptly it s like a raging battle He ll motor along with a standard blues shuffle and then suddenly approaching a curve slam on the accelerator and careen screeching into his own freaky staccato Funksville Bobby doesn t just perform the blues He s possessed by them He plays so angry and sings so hurt it s like a catharsis maybe even an exorcism for both him and his audience When I see or hear Bobby I don t feel much like dancing despite his exhortation early on this live recording I d rather sit back close my eyes and let his playing zap my central nervous system like some sort of musical electroshock therapy In 1991 Radcliff underwent two hand surgeries from which he made a full recovery and continued touring and playing at festivals His 1991 release Universal Blues illustrated his continuous versatility and increasing talent as described by Dick Shurman As Bobby typifies in the hands of a virtuoso who can defy the apparent limits of two hands and one guitar the juggled parts interweave deftly punctuating snarling squalling grinding bends with relentless drive In 2005 Radcliff released Natural Ball with producer Bill Bowman on the Rollo Label Like all his records it was released to critical acclaim Here s what the July 2005 issue of Blues Revue Magazine had to say Radcliff one of the most under recognized players on the scene is a phenomenally gifted musician whose soulful delivery funky picking and sparse stinging West Side sound as personified by his hero Magic Sam is distinctive and electrifying Switching from lead to rhythm faster than you can say Freddie King Radcliff s style is so personalized that he even makes over recorded material such as Catfish Blues his own his John Lee Hooker moaning and clipped taut effects free guitar lines burn with vicious fluidity Radcliff subsequently recorded Freaking Me Out Krellno Records released in 2011 which was his first all originals CD This CD produced by Chris Matheos who is also the bassist on this record also features Radcliff s original artwork on the front cover and inside Here s what Blue Review Magazine writer Thomas J Cullen III said about Freaking Me Out July August Issue 2011 The latest album from the NYC based guitarist vocalist is his first in seven years and the first filled with all original material One of the chief exponents of the West Side sound Although he grew up in Washington DC Radcliff was mentored in Chicago by Magic Sam one of the few living guitarists who can make that claim I was fortunate to see Magic Sam live and I ve seen Radcliff live a number of times most recently in NYC in March of this year I can say without hesitation that he is the closest guitarist to Magic Sam I ve ever heard His new CD June 2016 Absolute Hell is another record of all originals produced by Chris Matheos and Radcliff He builds on the music that has served him well and stretches it into new directions With slivers of reggae punk humor and darkness the title is after all Absolute Hell it is a melting pot of songs lyrical and instrumentals that will underscore Radcliff s continuation as a vital musician on the scene today Absolute Hell and Freaking Me Out are each rounded out by Radcliff s paintings which grace the cover Other interesting facts about Radcliff include his time spent with Jimi Hendrix in August 1967 during the week when Are You Experienced was initially released in the United States Radcliff was 15 years old and borrowed his mother s car to drive Hendrix to his shows at the Ambassador Theater at 18th and Columbia in Washington D C and then to parties that followed each performance that week Radcliff said the first shows were nearly empty but once the record hit they were packed He remembered that Hendrix consistently played with the same passion and intensity each night whether there were only a few people in the audience or the theater was at capacity Radcliff is considered an authority on Magic Sam and continues to carry on that West Side Chicago Blues style but is widely acknowledged as a true original with his sound He plays many styles on acoustic guitar with his trio but is often seen playing his signature Gibson Les Paul He remains an active bandleader and in demand guitarist and singer He continues his steady monthly residency at Terra Blues in New York City which began in 1994 In addition he performs throughout the United States and Europe In 2015 he was inducted into the New York Blues Hall of Fame as a Master Blues Artist He has recently guested with Al Copley s Roomful of Blues Reunion Band The Nighthawks Bob

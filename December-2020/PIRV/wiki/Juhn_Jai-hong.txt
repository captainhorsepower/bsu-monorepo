said I pursued the path of an opera singer for more than 20 years I had completed my studies but felt that classical music limited my expression I also studied drawing as well and I felt that cinema was the perfect way to express all these things together He then studied business management at Webster University Vienna because he thought it was related to directing A director must lead the entire project and all of his cast and crew it s all about management After making the decision to pursue filmmaking he moved back to New York City paid US 200 for a hand held camera and started shooting short films He said being in Manhattan was a great advantage because there were so many venues to shoot and getting permits was relatively easy From 2004 to 2007 Juhn shot a total of 14 short films among which Color competed at the 2005 New York International Independent Film and Video Festival He said I had no fear I had no knowledge about movies which was what actually enabled me to do it Kim Ki duk prot g Juhn wanted to direct an array of movie genres and styles like his favorite directors Ang Lee and Jean Pierre Jeunet And after being completely enraptured by 3 Iron Juhn called South Korean director Kim Ki duk his idol saying He changed my life He met Kim by chance at the Cannes Film Festival and told him how he wanted to learn filmmaking from Kim that it would be better than attending a film school Kim agreed so Juhn went back to New York packed his belongings in eight hours and headed to Seoul It was his first time in his native country in 14 years As Kim Ki duk s prot g

feature film debut Beautiful Calling it a dark fairytale for adults that is deeply rooted in reality Juhn made a film about a woman who becomes the object of men s obsessions and abuse due to her beauty Played by Cha Soo yeon she attempts to uglify herself from binge eating to starvation Along the way a police officer Lee Chun hee constantly watches her but his sympathy also turns into lustful desire Beautiful premiered at the Panorama section of the 58th Berlin International Film Festival and won the Grand Prix at the 2008 Fukuoka Asian Film Festival Kim who produced the film said it was good Beautiful displayed artistic sensibilities and thematic trappings that are automatically identified with Kim such as explicit expressions of fascination and loathing with the human body and an examination of ethics and morality through violence Local critics gave Juhn the nickname Little Kim Ki duk or Kim Ki duk Two but he said the comparisons to his mentor didn t bother him since he was still young and have much to learn Poongsan Juhn said when he came back from Berlin Beautiful opened on three screens and disappeared after two weeks I felt like a loser Despite his debut film having been invited to international film festivals Juhn struggled without new projects in Korea In 2011 Kim handed him another story idea because Juhn said Kim wanted a young director to bring a fresh perspective to inter Korean issues Poongsan follows a mysterious messenger played Yoon Kye sang who delivers letters and cherished memorabilia to separated families in North and South Korea Things take an unexpected turn when the taciturn young man is commissioned with the task of transporting the beautiful lover Kim Gyu ri of a high ranking Northern official who escaped to the South Unlike the perception that he was an arthouse filmmaker with Poongsan Juhn hoped to make a film that was first and foremost popcorn entertainment something young fun and edgy He said The film is essentially about reunification something that any Korean would want But as much as it s a somber subject I wanted to keep the film itself touching yet entertaining something that anyone can enjoy He hired Tim Starnes as music director and Juhn s own voice was featured in Robert Schumann s Die Lotosblume Juhn fought to cast Yoon a former pop idol in the lead role saying he liked Yoon s piercing gaze in the film The Moonlight of Seoul and felt they were both trying to challenge stereotypes The action film was shot in 25 takes in just 30 days including wire action sequences water stunts and CGI all on the low budget of 200 million US 185 580 The entire cast and crew took part in the project with no guarantee Though used to shooting fast and economically Juhn admitted filming Poongsan had been difficult like trying to climb K2 without oxygen but that he had wanted to show that it is possible to make a film with passion rather than money Critics and film industry professionals were later impressed with the production values Again produced by Kim Juhn s sophomore film received critical acclaim and mostly positive audience feedback Despite competition from Hollywood film Transformers Dark of the

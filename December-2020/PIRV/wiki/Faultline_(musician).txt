Everything which featured guest vocals from Coldplay s Chris Martin The Flaming Lips R E M s Michael Stipe While work is ongoing for his third Faultline project Kosten has continued to produce albums for other artists notably gaining recognition with Bat for Lashes double Mercury Music Prize nominated and Ivor Novello winning Two Suns and Fur and Gold and 2012 album The Haunted Man and Everything Everything Mercury Music Prize and Ivor Novello nominated Man Alive and 2013 album Arc Kosten co produced with Marina Diamandis her third studio album Froot The album was released internationally on March 16 2015 Background Early years As a youth Kosten burst his lung while playing clarinet for the National Youth Orchestra A London based art school drop out Kosten spent the better part of his twenties in his home studio teaching himself recording and production techniques and exploring far flung combinations of sound Faultline s debut single Control was built around death threats left on Kosten s answering machine It transpired that the intimidating messages had been left by a singer with whom Kosten had refused a collaboration Kosten appropriated the messages applying the threats alongside wayward noise rhythms and Steve Reich inspired neo classical music Closer Colder On his debut album Closer Colder released via the Leaf label in 1999 Kosten continued this approach to music making using samples in place of vocals Most notably the album s title track lifted Dennis Hopper s voice from Blue Velvet Kosten is reported to have obtained permission to use the sample directly from Hopper and David Lynch Closer Colder showcased Kosten s arranging abilities and this elegant blend of soundscape and avant garde was met with widespread acclaim The Times 25 9 99 an album so supremely modernist that it approaches the classical Closer Colder can both stir deep emotion and chill to the bone The sweetest cello trumpet and violin resonate against a background of abrasive electronica emotional and sonic disjunction are rarely as eloquently expressed as this DJ 10 99 a quite breathtaking visionary album that promises to take listeners to places they ve never been before one of the finest experimental albums this year Q 11 99 Closer Colder brims with invention An accomplished intriguing distinctly Lynchian debut Esquire Magazine top 10 album of the year Your Love Means Everything Released three years later Your Love Means Everything was an instant testament to the fruits of Kosten s ongoing sonic experimentation as well as his skill at creating an environment in which inspiration strikes his collaborators The album originally released on Rough Trade owner Geoff Travis Blanco Y Negro imprint in 2002 fell prey to label politics but re released by EMI Capitol in 2004 and awash in spectral electronic melancholy it received high praise Faultline s heady combination of electronic avant garde classical dance is thematically about complicated as it sounds but Kosten s vision translates aurally as a series of threadbare hauntingly programmed compositions each simplistic and engrossing Pitchfork Exquisitely moving Mojo Devastating and compelling The Sunday Times A must hear record 12 songs of heart shattering sadness NMEOn Your Love Means Everything the Faultline attitude to voices was inverted with vocal contributions from Coldplay s Chris Martin Jacob Golden the Flaming Lips Wayne Coyne and Steven Drozd Cannibal Ox and R E M s Michael Stipe Coldplay s Chris Martin hadn t even begun recording A Rush of Blood to the Head when he sang on two Faultline tracks Where is My Boy and Your Love Means Everything Part 2 The Flaming Lips were just outgrowing their cult status when they collaborated on The Colossal Gray Sunshine With gentle hypnotic beats that kaleidoscope into multicoloured atmospheric sounds the tone of Your Love Means Everything can be summed up with this track With its cinematic nightmarish feel the song serves as the lynchpin of the album which Rolling Stone called a masterpiece of widescreen psychedelic soft rock R E M s Michael Stipe collaborated on a cover of Greenfields a piece of dark Americana from late 50s folk revivalists The Brothers Four Kosten expressed incredulity about recording this his favourite childhood song with the R E M singer We Came from Lego Blocks is a fractured downbeat lullaby featuring vocals from Vordul Megilah of East Coast underground hip hop duo Cannibal Ox Cult singer songwriter Joseph Arthur collaborates on a truly eerie cover of The Rolling Stones Wild Horses while Biting Tongues features Ras B a ragga styled MC from Adrian Sherwood s On U Sound crew Other album tracks like Your Love Means Everything Theme for Half Speed and I Only Know Myself reveal the many degrees of Faultline s ghostly sublime and orchestral sound Third album Kosten is working on his third Faultline album Discography Albums Closer Colder 27 September 1999 Awake 4 52 Tiny Consumer 5 27 Mute 8
